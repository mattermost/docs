4. Install required packages: `pipenv install`
5. Build: `make html` - generates files in `/build` directory

## Contributing

**Signing CLA:**

Please read the [Mattermost Contributor Agreement](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) and sign it (at the bottom of the page), so you can be added to the Mattermost [Approved Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).

**Additional process for Core Committers for Doc Repo:**

These steps are to be followed only in situations of urgency or in situations where it is necessary to check that there aren't any high confidentiality issues. Otherwise the standard approval process should be followed.

1. “Needs Editor Review” label should be processed **after merge**.
2. IMPORTANT: Person conducting editor review needs to have their suggestions **merged by author**. Do this by mentioning the community.mattermost.com user name in the GitHub Pull Request.
3. Check weekly or bi-weekly that there are no “Needs Editor Review” labels on closed Pull Requests.

## Installation issues
