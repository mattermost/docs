# Cloud Native GitLab Helm Chart

**THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT DEVELOPMENT**

We are working on a new method of installing GitLab for customers who are
looking to deploy into container schedulers like Kubernetes.

While this is possible today using our [Omnibus GitLab based Docker image](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/README.html) and [corresponding Helm charts](https://gitlab.com/charts/charts.gitlab.io), there are challenges.
One key example is that an "all-in-one container" becomes a challenge to configure and operate at large scale.

To address this need we are working on the [Helm charts in this repository](#helm-charts) along with a new set of Docker containers that are specific to each component of GitLab.

For more information on all of GitLab's Helm Charts, please consult our [documentation](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/install/kubernetes/).

## Goals

We have a few core goals with this initiative:

1. Easy to scale horizontally
1. Easy to deploy, upgrade, maintain
1. Wide support of cloud service providers
1. Initial support for Kubernetes and Helm, with flexibility to support other
schedulers in the future

## Architecture

We plan to support three tiers of components:

1. Docker Containers
1. Scheduler (Kubernetes)
1. Higher level configuration tool (Helm)

The main method customers would use to install would be the [Helm Charts]() in this repository.
At some point in the future, we may also offer other deployment methods like
Amazon CloudFormation or Docker Swarm.

## Docker Container Images

As a foundation, we will be creating a Docker container for each service.
This will allow easier horizontal scaling with reduced image size and complexity.
Configuration should be passed in a standard way for Docker, perhaps environment
variables or a mounted file. This provides a clean common interface with the
scheduler software.

We plan to offer a container for the following services:

* Sidekiq
* Unicorn API
* Unicorn Web
* Gitaly
* Workhorse
* Pages
* Postgres (perhaps upstream Postgres), along with Postgres Exporter
* Redis Exporter
* GitLab Monitor
* Mattermost


We likely plan to leverage the following existing official containers for
underlying services:

* Docker Distribution ([Docker Registry 2.0](https://github.com/docker/distribution))
* [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/)
* Prometheus
* Node Exporter
* Nginx
* kube-lego

## Scheduler

We will launch with support for Kubernetes, which is mature and widely supported
across the industry. As part of our design however, we will try to avoid decisions
which will preclude the support of other schedulers. This is especially true for
downstream Kubernetes projects like OpenShift and Tectonic. In the future other
schedulers may also be supported like Docker Swarm and Mesosphere.

We aim to support the scaling and self-healing capabilities of Kubernetes:
* Readiness and Health checks to ensure pods are functioning, and if not to recycle them
* Tracks to support canary and rolling deployments
* [Auto-scaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)

We will try to leverage standard Kubernetes features:
* ConfigMaps for managing configuration. These will then get mapped or passed to
Docker containers
* Secrets for sensitive data

Since we are also bundling Consul, this may be utilized instead for consistency with other installation methods.

## Helm Charts

A Helm chart will be created to manage the deployment of each GitLab specific container/service. We will then also include bundled charts to make the overall deployment easier. This is particularly
important for this effort, as there will be significantly more complexity in
the Docker and Kubernetes layers than the all-in-one Omnibus based solutions.
Helm can help to manage this complexity, and provide an easy top level interface
to manage settings via the `values.yaml` file.


We plan to offer a three tiered set of Helm Charts

![Helm Chart Structure](images/charts.png)

### The GitLab Chart

This is the top level `gitlab` chart, which configures all necessary resources
for a complete configuration of GitLab. This includes GitLab, PostgreSQL, Redis,
Ingress, and LEGO certificate management charts.

At this high level, a customer can make decisions like:

* Whether they want to use the embedded Postgres chart, or to use an external
database like Aamzon RDS for Postgres.
* To bring their own SSL certificates, or leverage Let's Encrypt.
* To use a load balancer, or a dedicated ingress.

Customers who would like to get started quickly and easily should begin with this chart.

### The GitLab-Services Chart

This chart is dedicated to core GitLab services that make up the Idea to
Production workflow: code repository, issue tracking, CI/CD, monitoring, container
registry, etc.

This chart would also include options to configure exactly how these services
should work, whether all of them should be available, etc.

Included in this chart are the Helm Charts for each service:
* [registry](https://gitlab.com/charts/helm.gitlab.io/tree/master/charts/registry)
* sidekiq
* unicorn-api
* unicorn-web
* workhorse
* gitaly
* pages
* mattermost
* prometheus
* gitlab-shell

### Redis and Postgres Charts

We will also likely need to create specific charts for Redis and Postgres.
One reason is that there is a bug with variable handling between parent and
child charts, but also because we will need to include the respective exporters
as well.

## Quick-Start Installation
