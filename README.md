## Contributing

### Getting Started

You can edit or create Mattermost documentation directly in GitHub or by downloading the repo onto your machine and using an editor such as Atom. Consult the [Mattermost Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide) and [reStructuredText Markup](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/documentation-guidelines.html#restructuredtext-markup) section for stylistic and technical guidance. 

If this is your first time contributing to Mattermost, first read the [Mattermost Contributor Agreement](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) and sign it (at the bottom of the page), so you can be added to the Mattermost [Approved Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).


### Editing

The quickest way to begin is editing directly on GitHub on your fork of the Mattermost docs repo. Click the **Edit** icon on the top right corner of the page you want to edit in the Mattermost documentation.

If this the first time you're contributing, click **Edit the file in your fork of this project** (pencil icon) on the top right corner to create a fork. 

### Creating Pull Requests

1. When you're ready to submit your changes, add a descriptive title and comments to summarize the changes made.
2. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
3. Check the **Propose file change** button.
4. Scroll down to compare changes with the original document.
5. Select **Create pull request**. 

### Using Labels

Labels are used to track the lifecycle and status of a pull request. Using the correct labels helps with managing workflows and ensuring that content is edited, merged and released at the correct time. Take a look at the [Labels](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/labels/) page for information about how and when to use which labels.

### Commenting on Pull Requests

Once a pull request is submitted, multiple committers may comment on it and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Once a pull request has been submitted and the correct label assigned, the review process begins. This includes aligning the content with the Style Guide, validating processes, and tagging any other relevant committers. 

Once the review process is complete and depending on the type of issue it is (e.g., a typo fix vs. a new feature), the change is either merged into master and pushed immediately or merged into the release branch and pushed in alignment with the release. The branch is then deleted. 

Any merged PRs with an **Editor Review** or **Reviews Complete** label will be processed by the editor reviewer to ensure the documentation is correctly formatted at https://docs.mattermost.com/.

## Building and Validating

If you've downloaded the repo and are editing Mattermost documentation on your local machine, you can generate the HTML files from markdown in the `/source` directory. You can review them before you commit changes or create pull requests. 

1. Download the Mattermost docs repo onto a machine with Python installed.
2. Install [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/): `pip install pipenv`. 
3. `cd` into the cloned repository.
4. Install the required packages: `pipenv install`.
5. Build the doc set using `make html`. This generates files in `/build` directory.
6. Navigate to the `/build` directory to preview the page/s you've edited. 

The build process may generate this error: ``WARNING: toctree contains reference to document u'foo' that doesn't have a title: no link will be generated``. It can be ignored as it does not negatively impact the documentation.
