Bulk Loading Data

Large quantities of data can be imported from a `JSONL

You can import the following data types:

- Teams
- Channels (Public and Private)
- Users
- Users' Team memberships
- Users' Channel memberships
- Users' notification preferences
- Posts (regular, non-reply posts)
- Posts' Replies
- Posts' Reactions
- Posts' File Attachments
- Direct Message and Group Message channels
- Direct Messages and Group Messages
- Direct Messages from a user to themselves
- Permissions Schemes
- Custom Emoji

Importing additional types of posts is not yet supported.
