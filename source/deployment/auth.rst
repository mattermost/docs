Multi-Factor Authentication (Enterprise)
======
*Available in May 16, 2016 release* 

For increased security, Mattermost Enterprise Edition offers the option to require a phone-based passcode, in addition to email-password or Active Directory/LDAP authentication, to sign in to the Mattermost server. 

Supported phones include iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone devices that are able to install `Google Authenticator <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en>`_. Other than requiring internet access to download and install Google Authenticator, the phone used for Mattermost MFA does not require internet access.

Enabling MFA
------

This option can be enabled by the System Administrator in the `System Console <http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#service-settings>`_ under **Service Settings** > **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication**

End users can set up this feature in the `Account Settings <http://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#multi-factor-authentication-enterprise>`_ menu under **Security** > **Multi-Factor Authentication**.
