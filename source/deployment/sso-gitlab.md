# GitLab Single-Sign-On 
___
Single-Sign-On can be configured with the following services.

## GitLab 

Follow these steps to configure Mattermost to use GitLab as a single-sign-on (SSO) service for team creation, account creation and sign-in.

1. Login to your GitLab account and under **Profile Settings** go to **Applications**.
2. Add a new application called "Mattermost" with the following as Redirect URIs:
    * `<your-mattermost-url>/login/gitlab/complete` (example: http://localhost:8065/login/gitlab/complete)
    * `<your-mattermost-url>/signup/gitlab/complete`
  
    Note: If your GitLab instance is set up to use SSL, your URIs must begin with `https://`. Otherwise, use `http://`.

3. Submit the application and copy the given _Id_ and _Secret_ into the appropriate _GitLabSettings_ fields in `config/config.json`

4. Also in `config/config.json`, set _Enable_ to `true` for the _gitlab_ section, leave _Scope_ blank and use the following for the endpoints:
    * _AuthEndpoint_: `https://<your-gitlab-url>/oauth/authorize` (example https://example.com/oauth/authorize)  
    * _TokenEndpoint_: `https://<your-gitlab-url>/oauth/token`  
    * _UserApiEndpoint_: `https://<your-gitlab-url>/api/v3/user`  
  
    Note: Make sure your `HTTPS` or `HTTP` prefix for endpoint URLs matches your server configuration. 

5. (Optional) If you would like to force all users to sign-up with GitLab only, in the _ServiceSettings_ section of `config/config.json` set _DisableEmailSignUp_ to `true`.

6. Restart your Mattermost server to see the changes take effect.

#### Notes: 
- Only the default GitLab SSO is officially supported. "Double SSO", chaining GitLab SSO to other SSO solutions, is not supported. 
   - It may be possible to connect to use GitLab SSO in some cases with AD, LDAP, SAML, or MFA add-ons, but because of the special logic required they're not officially supported and are known not to work on some experiences.
   - If having official AD, LDAP, SAML or MFA support is critical to your enterprise, please consider purchasing [Mattermost Enterprise Edition](https://about.mattermost.com/pricing/). Given all the features of Mattermost, it's quite affordable. 
- See [GitLab section of Mattermost forum for troubleshooting help](https://forum.mattermost.org/c/general/gitlab).
- See [GitLab Omnibus documentation for installing GitLab Mattermost](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/gitlab-mattermost/).
