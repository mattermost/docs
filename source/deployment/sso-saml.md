## SAML Single-Sign-On (E20) 

### Overview

SAML Single-Sign-On integration offers the following benefits: 

- **Single-sign-on.** Users can sign-in to Mattermost with their SAML credentials.
- **Centralized identity management.** Mattermost accounts can display user information from SAML, such as first and last name, email and username.
- **Automatic account provisioning.** New Mattermost user accounts are automatically created the first time a user signs in with their SAML credentials on the Mattermost server. 

Mattermost officially supports Okta and Microsoft ADFS as the identity providers (IDPs), please see links below for more details on how to configure SAML with Okta and Microsoft ADFS. If you'd like, you may also try configuring SAML for a custom IDP.

##### [Configure SAML with Okta](http://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-okta.html) 

##### [Configure SAML with Microsoft ADFS](http://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-adfs.html) 

#### Pre-installation

Before configuring SAML with Okta or Microsoft ADFS, make sure you have the [XML Security Library](https://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/download.html) installed on your Mattermost instance. The XML Security Library is usually included as part of Debian GNU/Linux.

Also confirm if the `xmlsec1-openssl` library was successfully installed. If not, run
 - `apt-get install libxmlsec1-openssl` on Ubuntu
 - `yum install xmlsec1-openssl` on RHEL

#### Troubleshooting

The following are troubleshooting suggestions on common error messages and issues. 

##### 1. System Administrator locks themselves out of the system

If the System Administrator is locked out of the system during SAML configuration process, they can set an existing account to System Administrator using [a commandline tool](http://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/on-boarding.html#creating-system-administrator-account-from-commandline). 

##### 2. Received error message: `An account with that username already exists. Please contact your Administrator.`

This usually means an existing account has another authentication method enabled. If so, the user should sign in using that method (such as email and password), then change their sign-in method to SAML via **Account Settings > Security > Sign-in method**.

This error message can also be received if the `Username Attribute` of their SAML credentials doesn't match the username of their Mattermost account. If so, the user can update the attribute at their identity provider (for instance, back to the old value if it had been previously updated). 

##### 3. Received error message: `An account with that email already exists. Please contact your Administrator.`

This usually means an existing account has another authentication method enabled. If so, the user should sign in using that method (such as email and password), then change their sign-in method to SAML via **Account Settings > Security > Sign-in method**.

This error message can also be received if the `Email Attribute` of their SAML credentials doesn't match the email address of their Mattermost account. If so, the user can update the attribute at their identity provider (for instance, back to the old value if it had been previously updated).

##### 4. Received error message: `SAML login was unsuccessful because one of the attributes is incorrect. Please contact your System Administrator.`

Confirm all attributes, including `Email Attribute` and `Username Attribute`, are correct in both the Identity Provider configuration and in **System Console > SAML**.

##### 4. Unable to switch to SAML authentication successfully

First, ensure you have installed the [XML Security Library](https://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/download.html) on your Mattermost instance and that **it is available in your** `PATH`.

Second, ensure you have completed each step in our guides for [configuring SAML with Okta](http://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-okta.html) or for [configuring SAML with Microsoft ADFS](http://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-adfs.html).

Lastly, if you are still having trouble with configuration, feel free to post in our [Troubleshooting forum](http://www.mattermost.org/troubleshoot/) and we'll be happy to help with issues during setup.
