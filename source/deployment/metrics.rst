Performance Monitoring (E20)
===============================

*Available in Enterprise Edition E20*.

Performance monitoring support enables a Mattermost server to track system health for large Enterprise deployments through integrations with `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`_ and `Grafana <http://grafana.org/>`_.

The integration supports data collection from several Mattermost servers, particularly useful if you're running Mattermost `in high availability mode <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/cluster.html>`_.

Deployment Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Details on integrating your Mattermost server with Prometheus and Grafana.

Installing Prometheus
------------------------------------------------

1 - `Download a precompiled binary for Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/download/>`_. Binaries are provided for many popular distributions, including Darwin, Linux and Windows.

For install instructions, see `Prometheus install guides <https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/getting_started/>`_.

2 - The following settings are recommended in the Prometheus configuration file named ``prometheus.yml``:

.. code:: yaml

    # my global config
    global:
      scrape_interval:     60s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.
      evaluation_interval: 60s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.
      # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

      # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
      # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
      external_labels:
          monitor: 'mattermost-monitor'

    # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
    rule_files:
      # - "first.rules"
      # - "second.rules"

    # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
    # Here it's Prometheus itself.
    scrape_configs:
      # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
      - job_name: 'prometheus'

        # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
        # scrape_interval: 5s

        # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
        # scheme defaults to 'http'.

        static_configs:
          - targets: ["<hostname1>:<port>", "<hostname2>:<port>"]

3 - Enable performance monitoring in the Mattermost System Console and specify the listen address. See more detail in our `configuration settings documentation <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#performance-monitoring-beta>`_.

4 - To test the server is running, go to ``<ip>:<port>/metrics``.

5 - Finally, run ``vi prometheus.yml`` to finish configuring Prometheus.

For starting the Prometheus service, read the `comprehensive guides provided by Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/getting_started/#starting-prometheus>`_.

6 - Once the service has started, you can access the data in ``<localhost>:<port>/graph``.

While you can use the Prometheus service to create graphs, we'll focus on creating metric and analytics dashboards in Grafana.

.. note:: For troubleshooting advice, check the `Prometheus FAQ page <https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/faq/>`_.

Installing Grafana
------------------------------------------------

1 - `Download a precompiled binary for Grafana <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/debian/>`_ on Ubuntu or Debian. Binaries are also available for other distributions, including Redhat, Windows and Mac.

For install instructions, see `Grafana install guides <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/debian/>`_

2 - The Grafana package is installed as a service, so it is easy to start the server. See their `install guides <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/debian/>`_ to learn more.

3 - The default HTTP port is ``3000`` and default username and password are ``admin``.

.. note:: For troubleshooting advice, check the `Grafana Troubleshooting page <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/troubleshooting/>`_.

For user guides and tutorials, check the `Grafana documentation to learn more <http://docs.grafana.org/guides/basic_concepts/>`_.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help you get started, you can download three sample dashboards shared in Grafana:

 - `Mattermost Performance KPI Metrics <https://grafana.com/dashboards/2539>`_, which contains key metrics for monitoring performance and system health.
 - `Mattermost Performance Monitoring <https://grafana.com/dashboards/2542>`_, which contains detailed charts for performance monitoring.
 - `Mattermost Performance Monitoring (Bonus Metrics) <https://grafana.com/dashboards/2545>`_, which contains additional metrics such as emails sent or files uploaded, which may be important to monitor in some deployments.

See `this guide <http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/>`_ to learn how to import Grafana dashboards either from the UI or from the HTTP API.

Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost provides the following performance monitoring statistics to integrate with Prometheus and Grafana.

Custom Mattermost Metrics
------------------------------------------------

The following is a list of custom Mattermost metrics that can be used to monitor your system's performance:

Caching Metrics:

    - ``mattermost_cache_etag_hit_total``: The total number of ETag cache hits for a specific cache.
    - ``mattermost_cache_etag_miss_total``: The total number of ETag cache misses for an API call.
    - ``mattermost_cache_mem_hit_total``: The total number of memory cache hits for a specific cache.
    - ``mattermost_cache_mem_miss_total``: The total number of cache misses for a specific cache.

The above metrics can be used to calculate ETag and memory cache hit rates over time.

    - ``mattermost_websocket_event_total``: The total number of WebSocket events sent by type.

Standard GO Metrics
------------------------------------------------

The Prometheus integration also provides standard GO metrics for HTTP server runtime profiling data and system monitoring, such as:

    - ``go_memstats_alloc_bytes`` for memory usage
    - ``go_goroutines`` for GO routines
    - ``go_gc_duration_seconds`` for garbage collection duration
    - ``go_memstats_heap_objects`` for object tracking on the heap

To learn how to set up runtime profiling, see the `pprof package GO documentation <https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/>`_.  You can also visit the ``ip:port/metrics`` page for a complete list of metrics with descriptions.

If enabled, you can run the profiler by

    ``go tool pprof channel http://localhost:<port>/debug/pprof/profile``

where you can replace ``localhost`` with the server name. The profiling reports are available at ``<ip>:<port>``, which include:

    - ``/debug/pprof``/ for CPU profiling
    - ``/debug/pprof/cmdline``/ for command line profiling
    - ``/debug/pprof/symbol``/ for symbol profiling
    - ``/debug/pprof/goroutine``/ for GO routine profiling
    - ``/debug/pprof/heap``/ for heap profiling
    - ``/debug/pprof/threadcreate``/ for threads profiling
    - ``/debug/pprof/block``/ for block profiling
