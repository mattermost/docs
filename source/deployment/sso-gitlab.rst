GitLab Single Sign-On
=====================

Configure Mattermost to use GitLab as a single sign-on (SSO) service for team creation, account creation, and user sign-in.

.. Note:: Only the default GitLab SSO is officially supported. "Double SSO", where GitLab SSO is chained to other SSO solutions, is not supported. It may be possible to connect GitLab SSO with AD, LDAP, SAML, or MFA add-ons in some cases,  but because of the special logic required they're not officially supported and are known not to work on some experiences. If having official AD, LDAP, SAML or MFA support is critical to your enterprise, please consider `Mattermost Enterprise Edition <https://about.mattermost.com/pricing/>`__ as an option. 


Step 1: Add an OAuth application to your GitLab account
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Sign in to your GitLab account and go to ``https://{gitlab-site-name}/profile/applications``. For *{gitlab-site-name}* use the name of your GitLab instance. If you are using GitLab itself as your OAuth provider, use *gitlab.com*.
2. Add a new application:

  a. In the **Name** field, type *Mattermost*.
  b. In the **Redirect URI** field add the following two lines, using your own value for *{mattermost-site-name}*.

    .. code-block:: text

      https://{mattermost-site-name}/login/gitlab/complete
      https://{mattermost-site-name}/signup/gitlab/complete

    If your GitLab instance is not set up to use SSL, your URIs must begin with ``http://`` instead of ``https://``.

3. Click **Save application**.

Keep the GitLab window open because you need the *Application Id* and *Secret* when you configure Mattermost.

Step 2: Configure Mattermost for GitLab SSO
-------------------------------------------

1. On your Mattermost server, add the *Application Id* and the *Secret* to the *GitLab* settings section in the ``config.json`` file:

  a. Open ``config.json`` as root in a text editor. It's usually in ``/opt/mattermost/config`` but might be elsewhere on your system.
  b. Locate the *GitLabSettings* section and add or update the following information:

    .. code-block:: javascript

      "GitLabSettings": {
          "Enable": true,
          "Secret": "{mattermost-app-secret-from-gitlab}",
          "Id": "{mattermost-app-application-id-from-gitlab}",
          "Scope": "",
          "AuthEndpoint": "https://{gitlab-site-name}/oauth/authorize",
          "TokenEndpoint": "https://{gitlab-site-name}/oauth/token",
          "UserApiEndpoint": "https://{gitlab-site-name}/api/v4/user"
      }

    For ``{gitlab-site-name}`` use the name of your GitLab instance. If your GitLab instance is not set up to use SSL, the endpoints must begin with ``http://`` instead of ``https://``. If you are using GitLab itself as your OAuth provider, use *gitlab.com*.
    
    For ``UserApiEndpoint``, use ``https://{gitlab-site-name}/api/v3/user`` if you're running GitLab v8.17.8 or earlier.

2. [Optional] To force all users to sign-up with SSO only, in the *EmailSettings* section of ``config.json`` set *EnableSignUpWithEmail* to ``false``.

3. Restart your Mattermost server.

  On Ubuntu 14.04 and RHEL 6: ``sudo restart mattermost``

  On Ubuntu 16.04 and RHEL 7: ``sudo systemctl restart mattermost``

After the server restarts, users must change their sign-in method before they can sign in with GitLab.
