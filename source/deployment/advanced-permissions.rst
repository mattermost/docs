Advanced Permissions (E10/E20)
===============================

Advanced permissions offers Admins a way to restrict actions in Mattermost to authorized users only. The Mattermost permission system is based on a modified RBAC (role-based access control) architecture and will be rolled out over a number of server releases, starting with Mattermost server v5.0. The permissions interface can be accessed in the **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**.

.. note::

  This document applies to Mattermost Server version 5.0 and later. For previous versions, see `permission settings  available in the System Console > Policy page <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#policy>`__.

Permissions Structure
----------------------

Mattermost user interface surfaces a number of elements for Admins to control the permissions in their system.
  

System Scheme (E10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available in Enterprise Edition E10 and higher.*

Set the default permissions granted to System Admins, Team Admins, Channel Admins and all other members. The permissions granted in the System Scheme apply system-wide, meaning:

- Team Admins: permissions granted apply to all Team Admins, in all teams.
- Channel Admins: permissions granted apply to all Channel Admins in all channels, in all teams.
- All Members: permissions granted apply to all members, including Admins, in all channels, in all teams. 

To override the System Scheme default permissions in a specific team, you must set up a Team Override Scheme.

**System Scheme Interface** 

Interface for editing permissions in the System Scheme, with panels for All members, Channel Admins, Team Admins and System Admins. Available in System Console > Advanced Permissions > System Scheme:

.. image:: ../images/system-scheme.png

Team Override Scheme (E20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available in Enterprise Edition E20*

Overrides the default System Scheme permissions in specific teams for Team Admins, Channel Admins and all other team members. 

- The permissions granted in a Team Override Scheme apply only in the teams which are assigned to the scheme. 
- The System Scheme does not apply to teams that are added to a Team Override Scheme.
- Teams can only belong to one Team Override Scheme.

**Scheme List Interface** 

List of all Team Override Schemes in the system. Sorted alphabetically by scheme name. Also displayed is the scheme description and tags with all asociated teams. Available in System Console > Advanced Permissions > Permissions Schemes:

.. image:: ../images/team-scheme-list.png

**Team Override Scheme Interface** 

Interface for naming, assigning teams and editing permissions in a Team Override Scheme, with panels for All members, Channel Admins and Team Admins. Available in System Console > Advanced Permissions > Permissions Schemes > Team Override Scheme:

.. image:: ../images/team-scheme.png

Channel Override Permissions (E20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
*Available in a future release of Enterprise Edition E20*

Allows Admins to restrict permissions within specific channels. Permissions under consideration for this phase include:

- **Read-only Channels:** The ability for Admins to turn off posting in specified channels.
- **Restrict Channel Mentions:** Turn off the ability for users to post channel wide mentions (@-all/channel/here) in specified channels.
- **Channel member management:** Restricting adding and removing channel members to Admins only in specified channels.

Supplementary Roles (E20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
*Available in a future release of Enterprise Edition E20*

Allows Admins to grant additional permissions to specific users or to a group of users based on AD/LDAP group membership. Permissions can be granted within the scope of channels, teams or system level.

Recipes
--------
This section provides some examples of common permissions use cases and how to accomplish them using the Advanced Permissions System Console interface.

Team Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Restict adding members to only Admins, in specific teams**
Example: In Team A, only allow Team and System Admins to add new team members. As the default for all other teams, allow all users to add and invite new members.

1. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, edit the **System Scheme**.
2. In the **All Members** panel, check the box for **Add Team Members**. This sets the system default for all teams.
3. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, create a new **Team Override Scheme**.
  i. Name and describe the scheme. For example, ``Authorized Personel Only`` with description ``Restrict adding team members to Team and System Admins.``
  ii. Add Team B to the **Select teams to override permissions** list.
  iii. In the **All Members** panel, uncheck the box for **Add Team Members**.
  iv. In the **Team Admin** and **Channel Admin** panels, check the box for **Add Team Members**. 


Public and Private Channel Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Restrict who can rename channels and edit channel header and purposes**
Example: As the default for the entire system, restrict renaming channels and editing headers and purposes to Admins only.

1. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, edit the **System Scheme**.
2. In the **All Members** panel, uncheck the box for **Manage Channel Settings**.
3. In the **Team Admin** and **Channel Admin** panels, check the box for **Manage Channel Settings**.

.. note::

  Permissions for channel renaming, editing header and editing purpose are currently grouped in a single permission. These will be split into separate permissions in a future release.

**Restrict who can create channels, in specific teams**

Example: In Team C, restrict public channel creation to Admins. As the default for all other teams, allow everyone to create public channels.

1. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, edit the **System Scheme**.
2. In the **All Members** panel, check the box for **Create Channels** in the **Manage Public Channels** section. This sets the system default to allow creation of public channels on all teams.
3. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, create a new **Team Override Scheme**.
  i. Name and describe the scheme. For example, ``Contractor Scheme`` with description ``Restrict public channel creation to Admins only``.
  ii. Add Team C to the **Select teams to override permissions** list.
  iii. In the **All Members** panel, uncheck the box for **Create Channels** in the **Manage Public Channels** section.
  iv. In the **Team Admin** and **Channel Admin** panels, check the box for **Create Channels** in the **Manage Public Channels** section.

Post Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Restrict who can delete posts**

Example: As the default for the entire system, restrict deleting posts to only Team and System Admins.

1. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, edit the **System Scheme**.
2. In the **All Members** and **Channel Admin** panels, uncheck the boxes for **Delete Own Posts** and **Delete Others Posts**.
3. In the **Team Admin** and **Channel Admin** panels, check the box boxes for **Delete Own Posts** and **Delete Others Posts**.

**Restict who can edit posts**

Example: As the default for the entire system, only allow users to edit their own posts for five minutes after posting.

1. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, edit the **System Scheme**.
2. In the **All Members**, **Channel Admin** and **Team Admin** panels, check the box for **Edit Posts**.
3. From any panel, click the gear button to set the global time limit to ``300`` seconds.

.. note::

  The post edit time limit is a `global config variable <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#post-edit-time-limit>`__ ``PostEditTimeLimit``, so setting a post edit time limit applies system-wide to all teams and roles.


Integration Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Restict managing webhooks and slash commands**

Example: As the default for the entire system, only allow System Admins to create, edit and delete integrations.

1. In **System Console** > **Advanced Permissions**, edit the **System Scheme**.
2. In the **All Members**, **Channel Admin** and **Team Admin** panels, uncheck the boxes for **Manage Webhooks** and **Manage Slash Commands**.

.. note::

  Permissions for creating, editing and deleting integrations are currently grouped for each integration type. These will be split into separate permissions in a future release.

Administration Tools
--------------------

There are a number of CLI tools available for Admins to help in configuring and troubleshooting the permissions system:

1. `Reset to default permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-permissions-reset>`__: Resets all permissions to the default on new installs.
2. `Export permission schemes <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-permissions-export>`__: Exports the System Scheme and any Team Override Schemes to a jsonl file.
3. `Import permission schemes <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-permissions-import>`__: Imports the System Scheme and any Team Override Schemes to your Mattermost instance from a jsonl input file in the format outputted by ``mattermost permissions export``.

Backend Infrastructure
-----------------------

Technical Admins or developers looking for a deeper understanding of the permissions backend can refer to our :doc:`permissions-backend` technical documentation.
