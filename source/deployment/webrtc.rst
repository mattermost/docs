Video and Audio Calling (Beta)
=====================================

Mattermost supports an early preview of video and audio calling option using a self-hosted proxy. The implementation is based on WebRTC integration enabling one-on-one video and audio chat without plugins.

The feature is currently intended as a working prototype for community development and not recommended for production. It is supported on Chrome, Firefox and the Mattermost Desktop Apps on a server running in SSL mode.

Configuring video and audio calls
--------------------------

This option can be enabled by the System Administrator in the System Console under **Integrations > WebRTC (Beta)** - `see configuration settings documentation to learn more <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#webrtc-beta>`_.

To set up the WebRTC server, you may either

 - use a `Mattermost docker container created for testing WebRTC <https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/webrtc/>`_
 - set up a `Janus server <https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway>`_ to act as the WebRTC gateway and `Coturn <https://github.com/coturn/coturn/wiki>`_ for STUN and TURN servers for your Mattermost installation.

Starting a video call
--------------------------

After enabling the feature in the System Console by a System Administrator:

1. Go to **Account Settings > Advanced > Preview pre-release features** and select **Enable the ability to make and receive one-on-one WebRTC calls**.

2. Initiate a call with another user by either:

    Clicking the video icon on a user's profile popover, which appears after clicking their profile picture or name on the center channel or right hand sidebar

    Clicking the video icon on the channel header of a direct message channel with that user

Troubleshooting
--------------------------

As noted previously, video and audio calls are intended as a working prototype for community development and not recommended for production.
