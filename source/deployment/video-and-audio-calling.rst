Video and Audio Calling (Beta)
=====================================

The following open-source options are available:

1. `BigBlueButton plugin <https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/mattermost-plugin-bigbluebutton>`__ for one-on-one video and audio calling, video conferencing and screenshare, created by Blindside Networks, available in Beta. A test install is provided to try out the feature on a Mattermost install. For production use, you can self-host a server running BigBlueButton, or reach out to Blindside Networks about hosting it for you.
2. `Zoom plugin <https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/zoom.html>`__ enables users to start and join voice, video and screensharing meetings using either Zoom’s self-hosted private cloud or on-prem solutions, or its vendor-hosted SaaS solution. The plugin is installed by default on all Mattermost servers.

Support for other 3rd party video, audio and screensharing solutions via plugins is planned. A plugin for WebEx is currently in development by the Mattermost community, with updates posted in the `WebEx Plugin community channel <https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/webex-plugin>`__.

Note that you can also neatly link video, audio and screensharing solutions, like Zoom and Skype for Business, to channels by using markdown formatting in the channel header. Example: ``[Click for video call](https://link_to_solution)``.
