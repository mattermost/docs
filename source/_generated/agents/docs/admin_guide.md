# Mattermost Agents Admin Guide

This guide covers installing, configuring, and managing the Mattermost Agents plugin. You'll learn how to set up AI capabilities for your Mattermost instance and configure them for your organization's needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Agents plugin, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- Mattermost Server v10.0+
- PostgreSQL database
- For semantic search: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Network access to your chosen LLM provider
- API keys if using a cloud LLM service

### Installation Steps

#### Use pre-installed plugin

From Mattermost v10.3, Agents comes installed automatically and ready for you to configure a large language model (LLM). When no LLMs are configured, the Agents panel prompts users to configure one.

#### Install latest version

For the most recent features and improvements, you can download and install the latest plugin version from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ai/releases). 

Install the plugin through the System Console by navigating to **System Console > Plugin Management**, clicking **Upload Plugin**, selecting the downloaded plugin file (.tar.gz), and clicking **Upload**. Enable the plugin after upload completes, then configure plugin settings as detailed in the Configuration section below.

## Configuration

### Access plugin settings

Navigate to **System Console > Plugins > Agents** to access the configuration interface.

### Enable the plugin

Agents is enabled automatically when using the pre-installed version. If you've manually installed a newer version, you may need to enable it by going to **System Console > Plugins > Agents** and setting **Enable Plugin** to **True**, then complete configuration in the System Console.

### Basic configuration

If you have an Enterprise, or Enterprise Advanced license, upload it to unlock additional features. If you don't have a license but are running Mattermost Enterprise Edition, an Entry license will be automatically applied for you.

For general settings, you can toggle to enable or disable the plugin system-wide, enable debug logging for troubleshooting (use only when needed), enable token usage logging for tracking LLM interactions, and configure the hostname allowlist for API calls.

### Service configuration

Configure an LLM provider (Service) for your Agents integration. Services manage the connection to the LLM provider, including authentication and model defaults. You can create multiple services for different providers or configurations, and share them across multiple agents.

Navigate to **System Console > Plugins > Agents** and select **Add a Service**.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Internal name for this service configuration |
| **Type** | LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Cohere, Mistral, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible) |
| **API Key** | Your provider's API key (requirements vary by provider) |
| **Default Model** | Default model to use for this service |
| **Input Token Limit** | Maximum tokens allowed in input |
| **Output Token Limit** | Maximum tokens allowed in output |
| **Streaming Timeout Seconds** | Timeout in seconds for streaming responses |
| **Send User ID** | Whether to send Mattermost user IDs to the LLM provider |
| **Use Responses API** | (OpenAI/Compatible only) Enable OpenAI's Responses API for richer tool integration |

#### Provider Specific Settings

Each provider has specific configuration requirements:

| Provider | Required Settings | Optional Settings |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **OpenAI** | API Key | Organization ID, API URL (for compatible services) |
| **Anthropic** | API Key | |
| **AWS Bedrock** | AWS Region | API Key (can use IAM role), Access/Secret Keys |
| **Cohere** | API Key | |
| **Mistral** | API Key | |
| **Azure OpenAI** | API Key, API URL | |

For AWS Bedrock, authentication can be configured using AWS credentials in the API Key/Secret fields, or by using IAM roles when running Mattermost on AWS infrastructure.

See the [Provider Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/agents/docs/providers.html) for detailed provider-specific configuration.

### Agent configuration

Create an Agent (Bot) that uses a configured Service. Multiple Agents can use the same Service configuration. See [license requirements](#license-requirements) for details on features that require a license.

Navigate to **System Console > Plugins > Agents** and select **Add an Agent**.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Display Name** | User-facing name shown in Mattermost |
| **Agent Username** | The mattermost username for the agent. @ mentions to the agent will use this name |
| **Agent Avatar** | Custom image for the agent |
| **Service** | Select a configured Service from the dropdown |
| **Model** | (Optional) Override the service's default model for this agent |
| **Custom Instructions** | Custom instructions that define the agent's personality and capabilities |
| **Enable Vision** | Enable Vision to allow the agent to process images. Requires a compatible model and service. |
| **Enable Tools** | By default some tool use is enabled to allow for features such as integrations with JIRA. Disabling this allows use of models that do not support or are not very good at tool use. Some features will not work without tools. |
| **Access Control** | Set which teams, channels, and users can access this agent |

#### LLM Specific Agent Settings

Some capabilities are available depending on the selected Service and its configuration:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Web Search** | Available for OpenAI (with Responses API enabled on the Service) and Anthropic. Allows the Agent to leverage the provider's native web search tool to respond with recent information. |
| **Reasoning Enabled** | Available for OpenAI (with Responses API) and Anthropic. Enables "thinking" or reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. |

Select **Save** to create the agent.

### Custom instructions

Text input in the custom instructions field is included in the prompt for every request. Use this to give your agents extra context or instructions. 

For example, you could list your organization's specific acronyms so the agent knows your vernacular and users can ask for definitions. Or you could give it specialized instructions like adopting a specific personality or following a certain workflow. By customizing the instructions for each individual agent, you can create a more tailored AI experience for your specific needs.

### Embed search configuration

To enable semantic search capabilities, you'll need to enable the `pgvector` extension in your PostgreSQL database, then configure embeddings provider settings including the provider (OpenAI, etc.), model for embeddings, and dimensions that match your chosen embedding model. Embedding search requires a license (see [license requirements](#license-requirements)) and is available as an [experimental](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/feature-labels.html#experimental) feature. Performance may vary with large datasets.

Configure chunking options based on your needs:

| Setting | Recommended Value | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Chunking Strategy** | Sentences, Paragraphs, or Fixed Size | Choose based on your content type |
| **Chunk Size** | 512-1024 tokens | Varies by strategy |
| **Chunk Overlap** | 20-50 tokens | For better context continuity |
| **Minimum Size Ratio** | Default | Minimum ratio for chunk size validation |

Run the initial indexing process after configuration.

### Permission configuration

Configure who can access AI features by setting team-level, channel-level, and user-level permissions for each agent.

## Management tasks

### Plugin metrics

Metrics for Agents are exposed through the `/plugins/mattermost-ai/metrics` subpath under the existing Mattermost server metrics endpoint. This is controlled by the Listen address for performance configuration setting. It defaults to port `8067`, and the following metrics are available:

- `agents_system_plugin_start_timestamp_seconds`: The time the plugin started.
- `agents_system_plugin_info`: The plugin version and installation ID.
- `agents_api_time_seconds`: How long to execute API.
- `agents_http_requests_total`: The total number of API requests.
- `agents_http_errors_total`: The total number of http API errors.
- `agents_llm_requests_total`: The total number of requests to upstream LLMs.

### Token usage tracking

The Agents plugin can track token usage for all LLM interactions to support billing and usage analytics. When enabled, token usage data is logged to a dedicated file at `logs/agents/token_usage.log` in JSON format, capturing detailed information about each request:

- **User ID**: The Mattermost user who initiated the request
- **Team ID**: The team context for the request
- **Bot Username**: Which agent was used for the interaction
- **Input Tokens**: Number of tokens in the request to the LLM
- **Output Tokens**: Number of tokens in the LLM response
- **Total Tokens**: Combined input and output token count

To enable token usage tracking, navigate to **System Console > Plugins > Agents** and set **Enable Token Usage Logging** to **True**. When enabled, log files automatically rotate when they reach 100MB in size, and rotated log files are compressed to save disk space. The token usage logs provide administrators with visibility into LLM usage patterns and can be used for cost tracking and resource planning. All major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) report usage data that gets captured by this logging system.

#### Converting token usage logs for analysis

The token usage log file contains one JSON object per line, which is not directly compatible with tools like Microsoft Excel. Use these commands to convert the logs to different formats. Each requires `jq` to be installed for easy JSON parsing:

**Convert to Excel-compatible JSON:**

```bash
jq -s '.' logs/agents/token_usage.log > token_usage.json
```

**Convert to CSV format:**

```bash
echo "timestamp,user_id,team_id,bot_username,input_tokens,output_tokens,total_tokens" > token_usage.csv
jq -r '[.timestamp, .user_id, .team_id, .bot_username, .input_tokens, .output_tokens, .total_tokens] | @csv' logs/agents/token_usage.log >> token_usage.csv
```

### Post indexing

Post indexing occurs automatically during initial setup and when changing embedding providers:

1. Navigate to **System Console > Plugins > Agents > Embedding Search**
2. Use the reindex controls to:
   
   - Monitor indexing progress during initial setup.
   - Trigger reindexing when changing embedding providers.
   - Check indexing status.

### Backup and restore

The plugin configuration is stored in the Mattermost database. To backup:

1. Ensure your regular Mattermost backup includes plugin configurations
2. For larger deployments, consider backing up indexed vector data separately

### Configuration format

The plugin uses a service-based architecture stored in the Mattermost database at `PluginSettings.Plugins["mattermost-ai"]`:

- **Services** define LLM provider configurations (API keys, models, endpoints)
- **Bots** reference services by ID and define agent personalities and access controls

This separation allows multiple bots to share the same LLM service configuration.

**Configuration structure:**
```json
{
  "config": {
    "services": [
      {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "name": "OpenAI Service",
        "type": "openai",
        "apiKey": "sk-...",
        "defaultModel": "gpt-4o"
      }
    ],
    "bots": [
      {
        "id": "bot-001",
        "name": "ai",
        "displayName": "AI Assistant",
        "serviceID": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "customInstructions": "You are a helpful assistant."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Supported service types:** `openai`, `anthropic`, `azure`, `openaicompatible`, `asage`, `cohere`, `mistral`

**Legacy format:** Older configurations with embedded service objects within bots are automatically migrated to the current format on plugin startup.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enhanced logging can help diagnose issues:

1. Check server logs for entries with the structured logging field `plugin_ai` set to `mattermost-ai`.
2. Enable **LLM Trace** in the plugin configuration to see detailed request/response information for all LLM interactions.
3. Enable debug logging in the plugin configuration for additional diagnostic information.
4. For production environments, disable debug logging and LLM Trace after troubleshooting to reduce log volume.

## Integrations

Currently integrations are limited to direct messages between users and the agents. The integrations won't operate from within public, private, or group message channels.

### Built-in tool integrations

#### Server Search

- **Function**: Semantic search across Mattermost content.
- **Requirements**: Embedding search must be configured and enabled.
- **Security**: Respects user permissions - users only see content they have access to.

#### User Lookup

- **Function**: Look up Mattermost user information by username
- **Data Available**: Username, full name, email, nickname, position, locale, timezone, last activity, status
- **Permissions**: Requires `VIEW_MEMBERS` permission

#### Jira Integration

- **Function**: Fetch issues from public Jira instances
- **Requirements**: No additional configuration needed
- **Usage**: Provide Jira instance URL and issue keys
- **Data Retrieved**: Issue summary, description, status, assignee, comments, metadata

#### GitHub Integration

- **Function**: Fetch GitHub issues and pull requests
- **Requirements**: Mattermost GitHub plugin must be installed and running
- **Authentication**: Users must be logged into GitHub through the Mattermost GitHub plugin
- **Access**: Works with both public and private repositories (based on user permissions)
- **Data Retrieved**: Issue/PR title, number, state, submitter, body content

**Security Note**: All tool integrations are restricted to direct messages to maintain security boundaries and require explicit user approval before execution.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration allows Agents to connect to external tools and services through standardized MCP servers. This [experimental](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/feature-labels.html#experimental) feature enables expanding AI capabilities with custom integrations.

### Configuration

1. Navigate to **System Console > Plugins > Agents > MCP Servers**.
2. Enable MCP integration by setting **Enable MCP** to **True**.
3. Configure connection settings:

   - **Idle Timeout**: Set timeout in minutes for inactive client connections (default: 30 minutes)

### Add MCP servers

1. Select **Add MCP Server** to configure a new server.
2. Configure server settings:

   - **Server URL**: The endpoint URL for your MCP server.
   - **Custom Headers**: Additional headers required by your MCP server (optional).
   - **Server Name**: Descriptive name for the server (auto-generated if not provided).

4. Select **Save** to add the server.

### Management

- **Connection Management**: The system automatically manages user connections to MCP servers
- **Idle Cleanup**: Inactive client connections are automatically closed after the configured timeout
- **Per-User Connections**: Each user gets their own connection to MCP servers for security and isolation

### Atlassian MCP server authorization

When users connect to the Atlassian MCP server, they may encounter an authorization error requiring an organization admin to authorize your Mattermost domain. This configuration must be completed in Atlassian's admin console.

**To authorize your Mattermost domain:**

1. Go to [admin.atlassian.com](https://admin.atlassian.com) and select your organization.
2. Go to **Apps > AI settings > Rovo MCP server**.
3. Select **Add domain** and enter your Mattermost domain with the path wildcard: `https://your-instance.mattermost.cloud/**`
4. Select **Save**.

**Important:** The `/**` path wildcard is required. Example domain patterns:
- Single instance: `https://your-company.mattermost.cloud/**`
- All subdomains: `https://*.mattermost.cloud/**`
- Custom domain: `https://chat.yourcompany.com/**`

After adding the domain, wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate before users retry the connection.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify you have Organization Admin permissions (Site Admin is insufficient)
- Confirm you're configuring the organization that owns the Atlassian site
- Ensure the domain includes `https://` and the `/**` wildcard
- Check for typos in the domain

For more information, see [Atlassian's documentation on MCP server settings](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/).

> **Note:** The plugin currently doesn't render Markdown links (e.g., JIRA ticket links) in bot responses. URLs are displayed in plain text rather than as clickable Markdown-rendered links. This is not a bug but intended security behavior to prevent potential data exfiltration through links. While this limitation exists, improvements to link handling are being considered for future development. 

## Mattermost MCP Server

The Mattermost MCP Server enables AI agents and external applications to interact with your Mattermost instance through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This [experimental](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/feature-labels.html#experimental) feature is a standardized protocol that allows AI assistants to read messages, search content, create posts, and manage channels and teams programmatically. 

### Overview

The Mattermost MCP Server provides:

- **Direct Mattermost Integration**: AI agents can access your Mattermost data and functionality through a standardized API
- **Security and Permissions**: All operations respect Mattermost's permission system - users only access what they're authorized to see
- **Flexible Deployment**: Available as an embedded server for Mattermost AI agents or as an HTTP server for external MCP clients
- **Rich Toolset**: Comprehensive tools for reading, searching, and creating content

**Use Cases**

With the Mattermost MCP Server, you can:

- **Automate Channel Summaries**: Ask your AI agent to summarize activity across channels, catching up on discussions while you were away.
- **Share Updates Across Channels**: Have your agent post status updates to multiple channels simultaneously, keeping distributed teams synchronized.
- **Search Intelligently**: Search across your entire Mattermost workspace from any MCP-enabled client to find relevant discussions, decisions, or information.
- **Coordinate Teams**: Get lists of channel or team members to quickly identify who to contact or mention.
- **Automate Workflows**: Use external MCP clients to automate routine tasks like posting stand-up updates, creating project channels, or notifying teams of important events.
- **Access Context-Aware Assistance**: AI agents can read conversation threads to understand context before responding or taking action.

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools to AI agents and external clients:

- **read_post**: Read a specific post and its thread
- **read_channel**: Retrieve recent posts from a channel
- **search_posts**: Search across Mattermost content with optional team/channel filters
- **create_post**: Create new posts or replies in channels
- **create_channel**: Create new public or private channels
- **get_channel_info**: Retrieve channel details by ID or name
- **get_team_info**: Retrieve team details by ID or name
- **search_users**: Find users by username, email, or name
- **get_channel_members**: List all members of a channel
- **get_team_members**: List all members of a team

### Deployment

![MCP Server Configuration](img/system-console-mcp.PNG)

#### For AI Agents

To set up an embedded MCP server providing Mattermost AI agents with direct access to Mattermost functionality:

1. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Agents > MCP Servers**.
2. Set **Enable Embedded Server** to **True**.
3. When enabled, all configured agents can access Mattermost tools.

Agents will automatically use these tools when appropriate to complete user requests.

#### For External Clients

You can enable external MCP clients, such as Claude web, Claude Code, or other MCP-compatible applications, to interact with your Mattermost instance.

**Requirements:**
- Mattermost Server v11.2 or later
- Valid authentication method (OAuth or Personal Access Token)

**Note:** The server uses streamable HTTP transport and does not support traditional Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport. External clients must use the streamable HTTP transport available at the `/mcp` endpoint.

To enable an external MCP client:

1. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Agents > MCP Servers**
2. Set **Enable Mattermost MCP Server (HTTP)** to **True**.
The MCP server will be available at: `https://your-mattermost-server/plugins/mattermost-ai/mcp-server/mcp`

**Authentication:**

*OAuth 2.0*

The MCP server supports OAuth 2.0 authentication with both manual and automatic client registration.

**Prerequisites:**
- Enable OAuth 2.0 service provider in **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**:
  - Set **Enable OAuth 2.0 Service Provider** to **True**
  - For automatic client registration, set **Enable OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration** to **True** (Note: DCR is an unprotected endpoint, meaning it is publicly accessible and does not require authentication—anyone can register OAuth clients if this feature is enabled. See the [OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/authentication/oauth2/) for security considerations.)

**Client Registration Methods:**
- **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR/RFC 7591)**: External clients can automatically register and obtain credentials without manual setup.
- **Manual Registration**: Create OAuth applications through **Product menu > Integrations > OAuth 2.0 Applications**. See the [OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/authentication/oauth2/) for details.

**Additional Details:**
- Supports both public clients (e.g., desktop applications) and confidential clients (e.g., server applications)
- Authorization through standard Mattermost OAuth flows
- OAuth metadata endpoints:
  - Protected resource metadata: `https://your-mattermost-server/plugins/mattermost-ai/mcp-server/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
  - Authorization server metadata: `https://your-mattermost-server/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

*Personal Access Tokens*

You can authenticate using Mattermost Personal Access Tokens (PAT):

1. Create a Personal Access Token in Mattermost (**User Settings > Security > Personal Access Tokens**).
2. Configure your MCP client to use Bearer token authentication with the PAT.
