When notifications are enabled, you're notified of all Mattermost activity by default with `badges <#badge-based-notifications>`__, `banner alerts <#banner-alerts>`__ and `sounds <#notification-sounds>`__. You can `customize your desktop-based notifications <#customize-your-notifications>`__ for Mattermost activity.

Badge-based notifications
-------------------------

Mattermost desktop app icons display the following types of badges:

- a dot badge for new activity
-  a number badge for new messages, @mentions, or keywords.

Banner alerts
-------------

Banner alerts in the desktop app are popup notifications that display in the top right corner of the screen and include activity details.

Notification sounds
--------------------

By default, message notifications include audible sounds.

Customize your notifications
----------------------------

To reduce the number of notifications you receive, select **Desktop and mobile notifications > Mentions, direct messages, and group messages**, and save your changes. With limited notifications enabled, you can also choose to receive notifications about replies to threads you're following by selecting **Notify me about replies to threads I'm following**.

You can change or disable notification sounds by going to **Desktop notification sounds > Message notification sound**.

Want to hear a sound when a Mattermost call starts? If your Mattermost admin :ref:`enables this Beta feature <configure/plugins-configuration-settings:enable call ringing>`, you can choose the sound that plays when a call is started within a direct or group message you're participating in by going to **Desktop notification sounds > Incoming call sound**.

Disable all desktop notifications
-----------------------------------

Select **Desktop and mobile notifications > Nothing** to disable all desktop and :doc:`web notifications </preferences/manage-your-web-notifications>`. 

Clear the **Use different settings for my mobile devices** to additionally disable all Mattermost mobile notifications everywhere you use Mattermost.
