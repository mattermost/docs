Set a custom status
--------------------

Set a custom status to display a descriptive status message and optional emoji next to your name in Mattermost. Other members can see your status anywhere they can see your name, such as the channel sidebar and in conversations. To set a custom status in Mattermost:

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  1. Select your profile picture, then select **Set a custom status**.
  2. Choose from a list of suggested statuses, or enter a new emoji and status. The Speech bubble emoji 💬  is used by default if you don't specify an emoji. A custom status can be a maximum of 100 characters in length.
  3. Specify when to clear your custom status.
  4. Select **Set Status**.

.. tab:: Mobile

  1. Select your profile picture, then selecting **Set a status**.
  2. Choose from a list of suggested statuses, reuse a recent status, or tap to enter a status and select an emoji. The Speech bubble emoji 💬  is used by default if you don't specify an emoji. A custom status can be a maximum of 100 characters in length.
  3. Specify when to clear your custom status.
  4. Tap **Done**. 

.. tip::

  - Custom statuses are enabled by default in Mattermost. System admins can disable this feature by going to **System Console > Site Configuration > Users and Teams > Enable Custom Statuses**. Disabling this feature also removes the ``Update your status`` prompts in Mattermost.

Clear a custom status

Set your availability as Do Not Disturb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set your availability to **Do Not Disturb** to disable all desktop, email, and push notifications when you are unavailable or need to concentrate. 

You can specify how long to disable notifications by selecting a preset expiration or setting a custom expiration. Your availability setting automatically reverts to its previous setting once the expiration is reached (this may take up to five minutes).
