To customize Mattermost channel sidebar options based on your preferences, select the gear icon |gear-icon| next to your profile picture, then go to **Sidebar**. 

Your channel sidebar includes `enhanced sidebar features </preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__, including custom, collapsible channel categories, drag and drop, unread filtering, channel sorting options, and more.

.. note::

    - The following sidebar settings apply to your current sidebar only.
    - You must manage sidebar settings individually for every team you're a member of.
    - You can manage these settings in a web browser or the desktop app. You can't manage these channel sidebar settings using the Mattermost mobile app.

Group unread channels separately
--------------------------------

You can control whether unread channels are grouped together separately in the channel sidebar, unless your system admin has    `disabled your ability to do so </configure/experimental-configuration-settings.html#group-unread-channels>`__.

Select **Sidebar Settings > Group unread channels separately > Edit** to group unread channels at the top of the channel sidebar in an **Unreads** category.

Number of direct messages to show
---------------------------------

You can set the default number of direct messages to show in the channel sidebar.

Select **Sidebar Settings > Number of direct messages to show > Edit** to define a default number of direct messages.

You can update the number of direct messages displayed in the channel sidebar at any time, regardless of the default you set. See the `manage direct messages </collaborate/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html#manage-direct-messages>`__ documentation for details.
