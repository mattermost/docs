Manage your thread reply notifications
======================================

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

You're :doc:`notified </preferences/manage-your-notifications>` in a :doc:`web browser </preferences/manage-your-web-notifications>`, the :doc:`desktop app </preferences/manage-your-desktop-notifications>`, and on your :doc:`mobile device </preferences/manage-your-mobile-notifications>`, for threads you're following when you're @mentioned or the messages contain a keyword you're tracking.

.. tip::

  - Mattermost auto-follows you on all direct and group messages, any thread you start, as well as any thread where you've been :doc:`@mentioned </collaborate/mention-people>` directly.
  - You can choose to :ref:`follow or unfollow any thread <collaborate/organize-conversations:follow threads and messages>` at any time.

You won't receive notifications for threads you're not following, or thread replies when they don't @mention you directly. However, blue message indicators show you unread thread replies you're not following in a given public or private channel. 

For all other messages, a channel appears bolded to indicate unread messages.

Customize your notifications
----------------------------

Follow all threads in channels automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can follow all threads in a channel automatically by going to **Channel Settings > Notification Preferences > Follow all threads in this channel and enable the Automatically follow threads in this channel**.

Get notified when threaded discussions are disabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your organization doesn't use threaded discussions, or you have :ref:`opted out of threaded discussions <preferences/manage-your-display-options:threaded discussions>`, you can configure Mattermost to notify you when someone replies to a thread you started, or have participated in. Go to **Settings > Notifications > Reply notifications** to choose one of 3 options:

- Receive notifications for messages in reply threads that you either start or participate in.
- Receive notifications on messages, but only in threads that you start.
- Don't receive notifications on messages in reply threads unless you're directly @mentioned.

Send automatic replies to direct messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Want to automatically reply to direct messages when you're out of office? When your system admin :ref:`enables the ability for you to do so <configure/experimental-configuration-settings:enable automatic replies>`, you can configure Mattermost to send custom replies to direct messages by going to **Settings > Notifications > Automatic Direct Message Replies**, selecting **Enable**, and composing your automatic reply message. 

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Are thread notification counts the same across all Mattermost clients?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Mobile app notifications only indicate unread threads with @mentions, and not general unread activity.

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, the **Threads** list bolds unread threads that don't contain @mentions.
