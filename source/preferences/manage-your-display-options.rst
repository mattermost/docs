Customize a theme
-----------------

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can customize any of the standard themes by selecting a standard theme and then selecting **Custom Theme** to load the standard theme into the custom theme color selectors.

Select **Custom Theme** to customize your theme colors and share them with others by copying and pasting theme vectors into the input box. Observe a live preview as you customize theme colors, then select **Save** to confirm your changes. Discard your changes by selecting **Cancel**, or by exiting the settings modal and selecting **Yes, Discard**. See the `customize your theme </preferences/customize-your-theme.html>`__ documentation to learn more about working with the custom theme color selectors.

  In Enterprise edition, if you are a member of multiple teams, you can optionally select the checkbox **Apply new theme to all my teams** to have the theme show up across teams. Otherwise, the changes will only apply to the current team.

Import a Slack theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can select **Import theme colors from Slack** to import a Slack theme. 

In Slack, go to **Preferences > Sidebar Theme** and open the custom theme option. From there, copy the theme color vector and then paste it into the **Input Slack Theme** input box in Mattermost. Any theme settings that are not customizable in Slack will default to the “Sapphire” standard theme settings.

        .. tip::

            **Compact** mode fits more messages on the screen by decreasing the spacing around posts, collapsing link previews, and hiding thumbnails so that only file names are shown. Some formatting types, such as block quotes and headings, are also reduced in size.

            When you select **Compact**, usernames are colorized by default, and username colors are consistent for all users. Disable the **Colorize usernames** option to display all usernames in a single color instead.
