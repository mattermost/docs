Manage your channel-specific notifications
===========================================

By default, your web and desktop notification preferences apply to all channels you’re a member of. You can customize your per-channel notification preferences for any channel you're a member of for the following actions:

- `Mute channels <#mute-channels>`__
- `Ignore channel-wide @mentions <#ignore-channel-wide-@mentions>`__
- `Auto-follow all new threads <#auto-follow-all-new-channel-threads>`__

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  You have 2 ways to manage notification preferences per channel:

  1. Select the channel name, then select **Notification Preferences** from the drop-down list.

  2. Alternatively, select the channel's **View Info** |channel-info| icon, and then select **Notification Preferences** in the right pane.

.. tab:: Mobile

  Tap the channel name, and then tap **Mobile Notifications**.

Mute channels
-------------

All channels are unmuted by default, including direct and group messages, as well as private and public channels. 

You can choose to mute or unmute a channel at any time as follows:

- Select **Mute Conversation** or **Unmute Conversation** for direct and group messages.
- Select **Mute Channel** or **Unmute Channel** for private and public channels.

Once a channel is muted:

- All notifications for that channel are disabled, including email, desktop, incoming call ring tones, and push notifications.
- The muted channel displays a mute icon next to the channel name.
- The channel is greyed out in the channel sidebar, and doesn't appear bold to indicate unread messages unless you’re :doc:`@mentioned </collaborate/mention-people>` in that channel directly.

Ignore channel-wide @mentions
------------------------------

By default, you're notified every time someone on your team uses channel-wide @mentions, including @channel, @all, or @here.

When you choose to ignore channel-wide @mentions in channels, the channel name is bolded in the channel sidebar for new unreads unless it's muted.

Auto-follow all new channel threads
------------------------------------

By default, you don’t automatically follow new conversation threads unless you start a thread or reply to a thread, follow a thread, or are @mentioned in a thread.

You can configure Mattermost to automatically follow every thread in a channel. When enabled, you can access all threads in the **Threads** view, and unfollow individual threads as you prefer.
