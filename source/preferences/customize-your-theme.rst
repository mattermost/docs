  :alt: Use the Settings icon to customize your Mattermost user experience.

The colors of the Mattermost user interface are customizable. You can choose from `five standard themes <#standard-themes>`__ designed by the Mattermost team, design your own theme based on a standard theme, or `import your theme colors from a Slack instance <#import-theme-from-slack>`__. Your theme changes apply to all teams you're a member of, and are visible across all Mattermost clients.

.. tip::

   Mattermost Enterprise customers can configure a different theme for every team they're a member of.

To customize your Mattermost theme:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Browser/desktop

    Select the **Settings** |gear-icon| icon, then go to **Display > Theme**. Select **Theme Colors** to choose from five standard themes designed by the Mattermost team. 

    Using Mattermost in a browser or the desktop app, you can customize a standard theme further to truly make it your own. After selecting a standard theme, select **Custom Theme** and modify your color choices based on your preferences. See the `custom themes <#custom-themes>`__ documentation to learn what's configurable, and see the `custom theme examples <#custom-theme-examples>`__ documentation for inspiration.

  .. tab:: Mobile

    Tap your profile picture, and select **Settings**, then go to **Display > Theme**.

Custom themes
