Guidelines for Contributing an Integration
===========================================
Contributing an integration is a great way to add new functionality to your system and to share your work with the community. We want the process to be easy and want to help you produce a great integration that others will enjoy as well.  
Please use the guidelines below to help you get started: 

**Plan your Integration** 
 - Outline the user stories that this integration will support.
 - Choose what `integration type <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/getting-started/how-should-i-integrate/>`_ is ideal for your user stories.
 - If required by your integration, determine the best authentication method for your integration (see more information on `Personal Access Tokens <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html/>`_ & `OAuth 2.0 applications <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/oauth-2-0-applications.html/>`_ to help you decide).
 - Consider the user experience. Review our `UX guidelines <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/fx-guidelines.html/>`_ on user design experience for ideas and guidance. We are happy to give feedback as well on our `Community server <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/>`_.

**Develop your Integration**
 - Check out our `Getting Started guide <https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started//>`_, review integration samples, or use our `Developer toolkit <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/toolkit.html/>`_ to help you as you start the development.
 - Don’t hesitate to ask for help from our team or other developers on our `Community server <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers/>`_ if you have questions or get stuck. 
 - Determine the process for installing and running your integration alongside Mattermost. Consider adding auto restart for server restarts. 
 - Test your integration to ensure it is working properly and that there are no surprises to your end users.

**Support your Integration through Documentation**
 - Share how your integration works and what it does in a Read.me doc. 
 - Create screenshots to highlight features and show off your integration.
 - Make sure you include a license file with your integration. We recommend Apache v2, MIT or BSD-3 to ensure your integration is compatible with Mattermost.
 - Provide instructions for installing and configuring your integration alongside Mattermost.  
 - Encourage feedback by telling others how they can communicate with you through GitHub or by reaching out directly.
 - As an example, check out `the Matterhorn integration <https://github.com/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn/>`_.

**Submit your Integration**
`Give us a link <https://www.mattermost.org/share-your-mattermost-projects//>`_ to your project and supporting materials. We’ll add it to our `community contributions <https://about.mattermost.com/community-applications//>`_ page for others to see.
