Disabling MFA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System Admins can disable this option by going to **System Console > Authentication > MFA**. When **Enable Multi-factor Authentication** is set to **false**, users can't opt to use or disable multi-factor authentication on their account via **Profile > Security > Multi-factor Authentication**.

MFA can be disabled for user accounts using the API. See the `Mattermost API Reference <https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/users/paths/~1users~1{user_id}~1mfa/put>`__ for details.
