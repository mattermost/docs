Configuring Google Apps as a Single Sign-On (SSO) service
---------------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to configure Mattermost to use Google as a Single Sign-on (SSO) service for team creation, account creation, and login.

.. note::

  The `Google People API <https://developers.google.com/people>`__ has replaced the Google+ API, which was deprecated by Google as of March 7th, 2019 `per their notice <https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown>`__.

Step 1: Create OpenID Connect project in Google API Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Go to `Google Cloud Platform <https://console.developers.google.com>`__.

2. Select **Credentials** in the left-hand sidebar.

3. Select **Create Credentials**, then select **OAuth client ID**.

4. Select the **Web application** as the application type.

5. Enter ``Mattermost-<your-company-name>`` as the **Name**, replacing ``<your-company-name>`` with the name of your organization.

6. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, select **Add URL**, then enter ``{your-mattermost-url}/signup/google/complete``. For example: ``http://localhost:8065/signup/google/complete``.

7. Select **Create**.

8. Copy and paste the **Your Client ID** and **Your Client Secret** values to a temporary location. You will enter these values in the Mattermost System Console.

Step 2: Enable Google People API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the `Google People API <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/plus/overview>`__, then select **Enable** in the header. This might take a few minutes to propagate through Google's systems.

Step 3: Configure Mattermost for Google Apps SSO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Log in to Mattermost, then go to **System Console > Authentication > OpenID Connect**.

2. Select **Google Apps** as the service provider.

3. The **Discovery Endpoint** for OpenID Connect with Google Apps is prepopulated with ``https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration``.

4. Paste in the **Client ID** from Google in Mattermost.

5. Paste in the **Client Secret** from Google in Mattermost.

6. Select **Save**.

.. note::
  When Mattermost is configured to use OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, the following user attribute changes can't be made through the Mattermost API: first name, last name, or username. OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 must be the authoritative source for these user attributes.
