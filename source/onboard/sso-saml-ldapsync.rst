Configure SAML synchronization with AD/LDAP
--------------------------------------------

In addition to configuring SAML sign-in, you can optionally configure synchronizing SAML accounts with AD/LDAP. When configured:

 - Mattermost queries AD/LDAP for relevant account information and updates SAML accounts based on changes to attributes (first name, last name, and nickname)
 - Accounts disabled in AD/LDAP are made inactive in Mattermost, and their active sessions are revoked once Mattermost synchronizes attributes.

To configure SAML synchronization with AD/LDAP:

1. Go to **System Console > Authentication > SAML 2.0**, then set **Enable Synchronizing SAML Accounts With AD/LDAP** to **true**.
2. Go to  **System Console > Authentication > AD/LDAP**, then set **Enable Synchronization with AD/LDAP** to **true**.
3. To ignore guest users when sychronizing, go to **System Console > Authentication > SAML 2.0**, then set **Ignore Guest Users when Synchronizing with AD/LDAP** to **true**. 
4. Set the rest of the AD/LDAP settings based on `configuration settings documentation </configure/configuration-settings.html#ad-ldap-settings>`__ to connect Mattermost with your AD/LDAP server.

 - If you don't want to enable AD/LDAP sign-in, go to **System Console > Authentication > AD/LDAP**, then set **Enable sign-in with AD/LDAP** to **false**.

5. To specify how often Mattermost synchronizes SAML user accounts with AD/LDAP, go to **System Console > Authentication > AD/LDAP**, then set a **Synchronization Interval** in minutes. The default setting is 60 minutes. If you want to synchronize immediately after disabling an account, select **AD/LDAP Synchronize Now**.
6. To confirm that Mattermost can successfully connect to your AD/LDAP server, go to **System Console > Authentication > AD/LDAP**, then select **AD/LDAP Test**.

Once the synchronization with AD/LDAP is enabled, user attributes are synchronized with AD/LDAP based on their email address. If a user with a given email address doesn't have an AD/LDAP account, they will be deactivated in Mattermost on the next AD/LDAP sync. 

To re-activate the account:

1. Add the user to your AD/LDAP server.
2. Purge all caches in Mattermost by going to **System Console > Environment > Web Server**, then select **Purge All Caches**.
3. Run AD/LDAP synchronization by going to **System Console > Authentication > AD/LDAP**, then select **AD/LDAP Synchronize Now**.
4. Purge all caches again in Mattermost by going to **System Console > Environment > Web Server**, then select **Purge All Caches** again. This re-activates the account in Mattermost.

  .. note::
    If a user is deactivated from AD/LDAP, they will be deactivated in Mattermost on the next sync. They will be shown as "Inactive" in the System Console users list, all of their sessions will expire and they won't be able to log back in to Mattermost.

    If a user is deactivated from SAML, their session won't expire until they're deactivated from AD/LDAP. However, they won't be able to log back in to Mattermost.

  .. note::
    SAML synchronization with AD/LDAP is designed to pull user attributes such as first name and last name from your AD/LDAP, not to control authentication.

    In particular, the user filter cannot be used to control who can log in to Mattermost, this should be controlled by your SAML service provider's group permissions.

See :ref:`technical description of SAML synchronization with AD/LDAP <sso-saml-technical>` for more details.

Override SAML data with AD/LDAP data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can choose to override SAML bind data with AD/LDAP information. For more information on binding a user with the SAML ID Attribute, please refer to this `documentation </onboard/sso-saml-okta.html#how-to-bind-authentication-to-id-attribute-instead-of-email>`__.

This process overrides SAML email address with AD/LDAP email address data or SAML Id Attribute with AD/LDAP Id Attribute if configured. We recommend using this configuration with the SAML ID Attribute to help ensure new users are not created when the email address changes for a user.

To ensure existing user accounts do not get disabled in this process, ensure the SAML IDs match the LDAP IDs by exporting data from both systems and comparing the ID data. Mapping ID Attributes for both AD/LDAP and SAML within Mattermost to fields that hold the same data will ensure the IDs match as well.

1. Set the SAML ``Id Attribute`` by going to **System Console > Authentication > SAML 2.0 > Id Attribute**.
2. Set **System Console > Authentication > SAML 2.0 > Override SAML bind data with AD/LDAP information** to **true**.
3. Set **System Console > Authentication > SAML 2.0 > Enable Synchronizing SAML Accounts With AD/LDAP** to **true**.
4. Run AD/LDAP sync by going to **System Console > Authentication > AD/LDAP**, then select **AD/LDAP Synchronize Now**.
