Workspace limits
================

There may be limits applied to your Mattermost Cloud workspace based on the type of subscription plan you have. These limits are applied across all users in your team. We'll let you know when you're halfway from reaching a limit, as well as when you're closer to it. 

When limits have been reached, data is archived. This data is not deleted, and can be accessed when you upgrade to a plan with higher limits. If you choose to downgrade your plan, for example from Mattermost Professional to Mattermost Starter, the limits will be applied to your existing data. 

In addition to these limits, visit our pricing page to see a complete list of features are available for each of our plans: https://mattermost.com/pricing/.

   These limits do not apply to self-hosted deployments.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Can I upgrade my plan to get a copy of my archived data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently you don't have to upgrade your plan to get your archived data. You can follow the steps provided `in this article <https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/cloud-data-export.html>`_ to export your data.

Does Mattermost delete data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When file and message limits are reached, your data is archived. While you can export your data anytime, if you don't log into, or use, your workspace for an extended period of time, your data may be deleted. We'll let you know ahead of time, so you can take action to reactivate your workspace.

If I have more than one team and I downgrade, which teams are archived?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first team you created is retained. The rest, if any, are archived.
