Workspace limits
================

There may be limits applied to your Mattermost Cloud workspace, based on the type of subscription plan you have. These limits do not apply to self-hosted deployments.

These limits are applied across all users in your team. We'll let you know when you're halfway from reaching a limit, as well as when you're closer to it. 

When limits have been reached, data is archived. This data is not deleted, and can be accessed when you upgrade to a plan with higher limits. If you choose to downgrade your plan, for example from Mattermost Professional to Mattermost Starter, the limits will be applied to your existing data.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Can I upgrade my plan to get a copy of my archived data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently you don't have to upgrade your plan to get your archived data. You can follow the steps provided `in this article <https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/cloud-data-export.html>`_ to export your data.

Does Mattermost delete data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When file limits are reached, your data is archived. You can export your data. However, if you don't log into, or use, your workspace for an extended period of time, your data may be deleted. We'll let you know via about this ahead of time though, so you can take action.
