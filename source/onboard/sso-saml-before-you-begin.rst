Before you begin
----------------

Before you begin, you need generate encryption certificates for encrypting the SAML connection.

1. You can use the `Bash script <https://github.com/mattermost/docs/tree/master/source/scripts/generate-certificates>`__ from the ``mattermost/docs`` repository on GitHub, or any other suitable method.
2. Save the two files that are generated. They are the private key and the public key. In the System Console, they are referred to as the **Service Provider Private Key** and the **Service Provider Public Certificate** respectively.
