Using the System Console, Mattermost Enterprise and Professional customers can migrate OAuth configuration to the OpenID Connect standard. A one-time, one-click conversion tool is available within the existing **OAuth 2.0** page. You can also go to **System Console > Authentication > OpenID Connect**.

Select **Convert to OpenID Connect** to migrate your active service provider configuration to the new standard. No further changes are required. 

.. note::
  - Inactive service providers configured for OAuth 2.0 are also migrated to the new OpenID Connect standard.
