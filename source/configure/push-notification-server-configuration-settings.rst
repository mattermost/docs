.. note::

  - Mattermost Enterprise, Professional, and Cloud customers can use Mattermost’s SLA-bound :ref:`Hosted Push Notification Service (HPNS) <deploy/mobile-hpns:hosted push notifications service (hpns)>` in one of two locations, including the United States and Germany.
  - Mattermost Team Edition customers can use Mattermost's :ref:`Test Push Notification server (TPNS) <deploy/mobile-hpns:test push notifications service (tpns)>`.
  - The TPNS is provided for testing push notifications prior to compiling your own service, and isn't available for Mattermost Cloud deployments. Ensure you’re familiar with its limitations.
  - Review the :doc:`mobile push notifications </deploy/mobile-hpns>` and :doc:`mobile apps </deploy/build-custom-mobile-apps>` documentation, including guidance on compiling your own mobile apps and MPNS, before deploying to production. See the :ref:`documentation <deploy/mobile-hpns:host your own push proxy service>` for details on hosting your own push proxy service.
  - To confirm push notifications are working, connect to the `Mattermost iOS App <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mattermost/id1257222717>`__ available on the App Store, or the `Mattermost Android App <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattermost.rn>`__ available on Google Play.
  - If you don't need or want Mattermost to send mobile push notifications, disabling this configuration setting in larger deployments may improve server performance in the following areas:

    - Reduced Processing Load: Generating and sending push notifications requires processing power and resources. By disabling them, the server can allocate those resources to other tasks.
    - Decreased Network Traffic: Push notifications involve network communication. Disabling them reduces the amount of data being transferred, which can enhance overall network performance.
    - Lower Database Load: Each push notification may involve reading from and writing to the database. Reducing these operations decreases the load on the database, improving response times for other queries.
    - Faster Response Times: With fewer tasks to handle related to notifications, the system can respond faster to other requests from users, leading to a better user experience.
    - Simplified Error Handling: Push notification services can sometimes fail or have latency issues, requiring additional error handling. Disabling these notifications simplifies the system's operations.
    - However, disabling push notifications can negatively impact user experience, communication efficiency, and overall productivity. It’s important to balance performance improvements with the needs of your organization and users.

.. note::

  - We recommend increasing this value a little at a time, monitoring system health by tracking :doc:`performance monitoring metrics </scale/deploy-prometheus-grafana-for-performance-monitoring>`, and only increasing this value if large channels have restricted permissions controlling who can post to the channel, such as a :ref:`read-only channel <onboard/advanced-permissions:read only channels>`.
  - Reducing this configuration setting value to **10** in larger deployments may improve server performance in the following areas:

    - Reduced Load on Notification System: Each notification generates a certain amount of computational and network load. By limiting the number of notifications per channel, the system processes fewer notifications, thereby reducing the load on servers.
    - Database Efficiency: Notifications are typically stored in a database. Fewer notifications mean less frequent database writes and reads, leading to quicker database operations and reduced latency.
    - Minimized Client Processing: Users' clients (e.g., desktop and mobile apps) have to fetch and process notifications. With fewer notifications, clients can operate more efficiently, reducing memory and CPU usage on users' devices.
    - Improved User Experience: An overload of notifications can lead to performance lags and a cluttered experience for users. Limiting the number ensures that users receive only the most important notifications, which can enhance usability and response times.
    - Network Bandwidth: High numbers of notifications can consume a lot of bandwidth, particularly if they are being sent to many users. Fewer notifications can lead to lower overall network usage and potentially faster delivery of critical messages.
    - Server Load Balancing: By reducing the number of notifications, the workload can be more evenly distributed across the servers, leading to better load balancing and preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
