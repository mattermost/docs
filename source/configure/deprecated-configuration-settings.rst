Bleve settings

Bulk Indexing Time Window Seconds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Removed in May 16, 2022 release*

This setting isn't available in the System Console and can only be set in ``config.json``.

Determines the maximum time window for a batch of posts being indexed by the Bulk Indexer. This setting serves as a performance optimization for installs with over ~10 million posts in the database. You can approximate this value based on the average number of seconds for 2,000 posts to be added to the database on a typical day in production. Setting this value too low will cause bulk indexing jobs to run slowly.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This feature's ``config.json`` setting is ``"BulkIndexingTimeWindowSeconds": 3600`` with numerical input.   |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Changes to this setting require a server restart before taking effect.

See the `Important Upgrade Notes <https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html>`__ for more information.

**True**: Web app plugins that package their own version of React DOM are patched to instead use the version of React DOM provided by the web app.

**False**: Web app plugins are loaded as normal.
