# Deploy Calls Kubernetes

```{include} ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.md
```

This guide provides detailed information for deploying Mattermost Calls on Kubernetes environments.

## Overview

Mattermost Calls has been designed to integrate well with Kubernetes to offer improved scalability and control over the deployment. For Kubernetes deployments, the RTCD service is strongly recommended and is the only officially supported approach.

## Architecture

![Calls deployed in a Kubernetes cluster](../images/calls-deployment-kubernetes.png)

This diagram shows how the RTCD standalone service can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. In this architecture:

1. Calls traffic is handled by dedicated RTCD pods
2. RTCD services are exposed through load balancers
3. Scaling is managed through Kubernetes deployment configurations
4. Call recording and transcription is handled by the calls-offloader service (see [Calls Offloader Setup and Configuration](calls-offloader-setup.md))

If Mattermost isn't already deployed in your Kubernetes cluster and you want to use this deployment type, visit the [Kubernetes operator guide](/install/mattermost-kubernetes-operator.md).

## Helm Chart Deployment

The recommended way to deploy Calls-related components in a Kubernetes environment is to use the officially provided Helm charts:

### RTCD Helm Chart

The RTCD Helm chart deploys the RTCD service needed for call media handling:

```bash
helm repo add mattermost https://helm.mattermost.com
helm repo update

helm install mattermost-rtcd mattermost/mattermost-rtcd \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.host=rtcd.example.com \
  --set service.annotations."service\\.beta\\.kubernetes\\.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol"=udp \
  --set rtcd.ice.hostOverride=rtcd.example.com
```

For complete configuration options, see the [RTCD Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-helm/tree/master/charts/mattermost-rtcd).

### Calls-Offloader Helm Chart

If you need call recording and transcription capabilities, deploy the calls-offloader service:

```bash
helm install mattermost-calls-offloader mattermost/mattermost-calls-offloader \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.host=calls-offloader.example.com
```

For complete configuration options, see the [Calls-Offloader Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-helm/tree/master/charts/mattermost-calls-offloader).

## Kubernetes-Specific Configuration

### Network Configuration

For Kubernetes deployments, you need to ensure:

1. UDP traffic is properly routed to RTCD pods (for media)
2. TCP traffic can reach both the Mattermost pods and RTCD pods
3. Load balancers are properly configured to handle UDP traffic
4. Network policies allow the required communications between services

Recommended annotations for AWS environments:

```yaml
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: udp
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb
```

### Resource Requirements

For optimal performance in Kubernetes environments:

1. **CPU**: At least 2 CPU cores per RTCD pod
2. **Memory**: At least 1GB RAM per RTCD pod
3. **Network**: Sufficient bandwidth for expected call volume (see benchmarks)

We recommend setting resource limits and requests in your deployment:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 1000m
    memory: 1Gi
  limits:
    cpu: 2000m
    memory: 2Gi
```

### Scaling Considerations

Horizontal scaling of RTCD pods is possible, but remember:

1. Each call is hosted entirely on a single RTCD pod
2. DNS-based load balancing should be used to distribute calls among pods
3. Health checks should ensure that only healthy pods receive new calls
4. Calls remain on their assigned pod for their entire duration

### Limitations

Due to the inherent complexities of hosting a WebRTC service, some limitations apply when deploying Calls in a Kubernetes environment.

One key requirement is that each `rtcd` process must live in a dedicated Kubernetes node. This is necessary to forward the data correctly while allowing for horizontal scaling. Data should generally not go through a standard ingress but directly to the pod running the `rtcd` process.

The general recommendation is to expose one external IP address per `rtcd` instance (Kubernetes node). This makes it simpler to scale as the application is able to detect its own external address (through STUN) and advertise it to clients to achieve connectivity with minimal configuration.

If, for some reason, exposing multiple IP addresses is not possible in your environment, port mapping (NAT) can be used. In this scenario different ports are used to map the respective `rtcd` nodes behind the single external IP. Example:

```text
EXT_IP:8443 -> rtcdA:8443
EXT_IP:8444 -> rtcdB:8443
EXT_IP:8445 -> rtcdC:8443
```

This case requires a couple of extra configurations:

* NAT mappings need to be in place for every `rtcd` node. This is usually done at the ingress point (e.g., ELB, NLB, etc).

* The `RTCD_RTC_ICEHOSTPORTOVERRIDE` config should be used to pass a full mapping of node IPs and their respective port.

  * Example: `RTCD_RTC_ICEHOSTPORTOVERRIDE=rtcdA_IP/8443,rtcdB_IP/8444,rtcdC_IP/8445`

* The `RTCD_RTC_ICEHOSTOVERRIDE` should be used to set the external IP address.

```{note}
One option to limit these static mappings is to reduce the size of the local subnet (e.g., to `/29`).
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

We recommend deploying Prometheus and Grafana alongside your Calls deployment:

1. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from both Mattermost and RTCD pods
2. Import the official Mattermost Calls dashboard to Grafana
3. Set up alerts for CPU usage, connection failures, and error rates

For detailed information on metrics collection and monitoring, see the [Calls Metrics and Monitoring](calls-metrics-monitoring.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

For Kubernetes-specific troubleshooting:

1. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -f deployment/mattermost-rtcd`
2. Verify service connectivity: `kubectl port-forward service/mattermost-rtcd 8045:8045`
3. Ensure UDP traffic is properly routed through your ingress/load balancer
4. Verify network policies allow required communication paths

For detailed troubleshooting steps, see the [Calls Troubleshooting](calls-troubleshooting.md) guide.
