## About Mattermost Calls

Mattermost Calls provides integrated audio calling and screen sharing capabilities within Mattermost channels. It's built on WebRTC technology and can be deployed either:

1. **Integrated mode**: Built into the Calls plugin (simpler, suitable for smaller deployments)
2. **RTCD mode**: Using a dedicated service for improved performance and scalability (recommended for production environments)

## Terminology

- [WebRTC](https://bloggeek.me/webrtcglossary/webrtc-2/): The set of protocols on which calls are built
- **RTC**: Real-Time Connection channel used for media (audio/video/screen)
- **WS**: WebSocket connection used for signaling and connection setup
- **SFU**: Selective Forwarding Unit, routes media between participants
- [NAT](https://bloggeek.me/webrtcglossary/nat/): Network Address Translation for mapping IP addresses
- [STUN](https://bloggeek.me/webrtcglossary/stun/): Protocol used by WebRTC clients to help traverse NATs
- [TURN](https://bloggeek.me/webrtcglossary/turn/): Protocol to relay media for clients behind strict firewalls

## Key Components

- **Calls plugin**: The main plugin that enables calls functionality.  Installed by default in Mattermost self-hosted deployments.
- **RTCD service**: Optional dedicated service for offloading media processing (Enterprise feature).  Typically deployed to dedicated servers or containers. See [RTCD Setup and Configuration](calls-rtcd-setup.md) for details.
- **calls-offloader**: Service for call recording and transcription (if enabled).  Typically deployed to dedicated servers. See [Calls Offloader Setup and Configuration](calls-offloader-setup.md) for setup and troubleshooting details.

## Network Requirements

- Run Mattermost server on a secure (HTTPs) connection. This is a necessary requirement on the client to allow capturing devices (e.g., microphone, screen). See the [config TLS](https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/server/setup-tls.html) section for more info.
- See [network requirements](#network) below.

### Client

- Clients need to be able to connect (send and receive data) to the instance hosting the calls through the UDP port configured as `RTC Server Port`. If this is not possible a TURN server should be used to achieve connectivity.
- Depending on the platform or operating system, clients may need to grant additional permissions to the application (e.g., browser, desktop app) to allow them to capture audio inputs or share the screen.

## Limitations

- All Mattermost customers can start, join, and participate in 1:1 audio calls with optional screen sharing.
- For group calls up to 50 concurrent users, Mattermost Enterprise, Professional, or Mattermost Cloud is required.
- Enterprise customers can also [record calls](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/make-calls.html#record-a-call), enable [live text captions](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/make-calls.html#live-captions-during-calls) during calls, and [transcribe recorded calls](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/make-calls.html#transcribe-recorded-calls). We recommend that Enterprise self-hosted customers looking for group calls beyond 50 concurrent users consider using the [dedicated RTCD service](#when-to-use-rtcd).
- For Mattermost self-hosted deployments, System admins need to enable and configure the plugin [using the System Console](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#calls). The default maximum number of participants is unlimited; however, we recommend a maximum of 50 participants per call. Maximum call participants is configurable by going to **System Console > Plugin Management > Calls > Max call participants**. Call participant limits greatly depends on instance resources. For more details, refer to the [Performance Considerations](#performance-considerations) section below.

## Configuration

For Mattermost self-hosted customers, the calls plugin is pre-packaged, installed, and enabled. Configuration to allow end-users to use it can be found in ``System Console > Plugins > Calls``.

## Deployment Architecture Options

Mattermost Calls can be deployed in several configurations:

### Single Instance Deployments

#### Integrated Mode

The WebRTC service runs within the Calls plugin on the Mattermost server.  This is the default mode when first installing the plugin on a single Mattermost instance setup. The WebRTC service is integrated in the plugin itself and runs alongside the Mattermost server.

![Integrated configuration model of a single instance](../images/calls-deployment-image3.png)

#### RTCD Mode

A dedicated RTCD service handles media routing, reducing load on the Mattermost server.

![Web RTC deployment configuration](../images/calls-deployment-image7.png)

### High Availability Deployments

#### Clustered Mode

This is the default mode when running the plugin in a high availability cluster-based deployment. Every Mattermost node will run an instance of the plugin that includes a WebRTC service. Calls are distributed across all available nodes through the existing load-balancer: a call is hosted on the instance where the initiating websocket connection (first client to join) is made. A single call will be hosted on a single cluster node.

![Clustered calls deployment](../images/calls-deployment-image5.png)

#### RTCD with High Availability

Dedicated RTCD services handle media routing for high availability.

![RTCD deployment with high availability](../images/calls-deployment-image2.png)

### Kubernetes Deployments

RTCD is the only officially supported approach for Kubernetes deployments. For detailed information on deploying Mattermost Calls in Kubernetes environments, including Helm chart configurations, resource requirements, and scaling considerations, see the [Calls Deployment on Kubernetes](calls-kubernetes.md) guide.

## When to Use RTCD

The dedicated RTCD service (available with Enterprise license) is recommended for:

- **Production environments**: Isolates call traffic from other Mattermost services
- **Performance optimization**: Dedicated service tuned for real-time media
- **Scalability**: Add RTCD instances as call volume grows
- **Call stability**: Calls continue even if Mattermost server needs to restart
- **Kubernetes deployments**: Required for officially supported Kubernetes deployments

For detailed RTCD setup instructions, see the [RTCD Setup and Configuration](calls-rtcd-setup.md) guide.

## Call Recording and Transcription

For call recording and transcription, you need to:

1. Deploy the `calls-offloader` service
2. Configure the service URL in the System Console
3. Enable call recordings and/or transcriptions in the plugin settings

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Calls Offloader Setup and Configuration](calls-offloader-setup.md) guide.

## Air-Gapped Deployments

Mattermost Calls can function in air-gapped environments. Exposing Calls to the public internet is only necessary when users need to connect from outside the local network, and no existing method supports that connection. In such setups:

- Users should connect from within the private/local network. This can be done on-premises, through a VPN, or via virtual machines.
- Configuring a STUN server is unnecessary, as all connections occur within the local network.
- The [ICE Host Override](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#ice-host-override) configuration setting can be optionally set with a local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.45), depending on the specific network configuration and topology.
- For call recording and transcription in air-gapped environments, see the [Air-Gapped Deployments](calls-offloader-setup.md#air-gapped-deployments) section in the Calls Offloader Setup documentation.

## Performance Considerations

Calls performance primarily depends on:

- **CPU resources**: More participants require more processing power
- **Network bandwidth**: Both incoming and outgoing traffic increases with participant count
- **Active speakers**: Unmuted participants require significantly more resources 

For detailed performance metrics, benchmarks, and monitoring guidance, see the [Calls Metrics and Monitoring](calls-metrics-monitoring.md) guide.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is calls traffic encrypted?**  
Yes, using WebRTC security standards (DTLS/SRTP). Traffic is encrypted in transit.

**Are there any third-party services involved?**  
Only a Mattermost STUN server (`stun.global.calls.mattermost.com`) is used by default. This can be removed if you set the ICE Host Override configuration.

**Is using UDP a requirement?**  
UDP is recommended protocol to serve real-time media as it allows for the lowest latency between peers, but TCP fallback is supported since plugin version 0.17 and RTCD version 0.11.

If clients are unable to connect using UDP (due to limitations or strict firewalls), you have a few options:

- Since plugin version 0.17 and `rtcd` version 0.11 the RTC service will listen for TCP connections in addition to UDP ones. If configured correctly (e.g. using commonly allowed ports such as 80 or 443) it's possible to have clients connect directly through TCP when unable to do it through the preferred UDP channel.

- Run calls through an external TURN server that listens on TCP and relays all media traffic between peers. However, this is a sub-optimal solution that should be avoided if possible as it will introduce extra latency along with added infrastructural cost.

**Do I need a TURN server?**  
Only if clients are behind restrictive firewalls that block UDP. We recommend (and officially support) [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) if needed.

**Can RTCD traffic be kept internal?**  
Yes, and it's recommended. Only the media ports need to be accessible to end-users.

**How will this work with an existing reverse proxy sitting in front of Mattermost?**

Generally clients should connect directly to either Mattermost or, if deployed, the dedicated `rtcd` service through the configured UDP port. However, it's also possible to route the traffic through an existing load balancer as long as this has support for routing the UDP protocol (e.g. nginx). Of course this will require additional configuration and potential changes to how the plugin is run as it won't be possible to load balance the UDP flow across multiple instances like it happens for HTTP.

**Do calls require a dedicated server to work or can they run alongside Mattermost?**

The plugin can function in different modes. By default calls are handled completely by the plugin which runs as part of Mattermost. It's also possible to use a dedicated service to offload the computational and bandwidth costs and scale further (Enterprise only).

See [RTCD Setup and Configuration](calls-rtcd-setup.md) for more details on the dedicated RTCD service.

**Can the traffic between Mattermost and `rtcd` be kept internal or should it be opened to the public?**

When possible, it's recommended to keep communication between the Mattermost cluster and the dedicated `rtcd` service under the same private network as this can greatly simplify deployment and security. There's no requirement to expose `rtcd`'s HTTP API to the public internet.

**Can Calls be rolled out on a per-channel basis?**

```{include} ../_static/badges/selfhosted-only.md
```

Yes. Mattermost system admins running self-hosted deployments can enable or disable call functionality per channel. Once [test mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#test-mode) is enabled for Mattermost Calls:

1. **Navigate to the channel** where you want to enable or disable Calls
2. **Access the channel menu** by clicking the channel name at the top of the channel
3. **Select the Calls option** from the dropdown menu:
   - Select **Enable calls** for each channel where you want Calls enabled
   - Select **Disable calls** for all channels where you want Calls disabled

![Channel menu showing Enable/Disable calls options](../images/calls-channel-enable-disable.png)

Once Calls is enabled for specific channels, users can start making calls in those channels.

```{note}
When [test mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#test-mode) is disabled for Mattermost Calls, users in any Mattermost channel can make a call.
```
