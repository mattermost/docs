Integrations configuration settings
===================================

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

Review and manage the following integration configuration options in the System Console by selecting the **Product** |product-list| menu, selecting **System Console**, and then selecting **Integrations**:

- `Integrations management <#integrations-management>`__
- `Bot Accounts <#bot-acocunts>`__
- `GIF <#gif>`__
- `CORS <#cors>`__

.. tip::

  System admins managing a self-hosted Mattermost deployment can edit the ``config.json`` file as described in the following tables. Each configuration value below includes a JSON path to access the value programmatically in the ``config.json`` file using a JSON-aware tool. For example, the ``EnableIncomingWebhooks`` value is under ``ServiceSettings``.

  - If using a tool such as `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`__, you'd enter: ``cat config/config.json | jq '.ServiceSettings.EnableIncomingWebhooks'``
  - When working with the ``config.json`` file manually, look for an object such as ``ServiceSettings``, then within that object, find the key ``EnableIncomingWebhooks``.

Integrations management
-----------------------

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

Access the following configuration settings in the System Console by going to **Integrations > Integration Management**.

.. config:setting:: enable-incoming-webhooks
  :displayname: Enable incoming webhooks (Integrations)
  :systemconsole: Integrations > Integration Management
  :configjson: .ServiceSettings.EnableIncomingWebhooks
  :environment: MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLEINCOMINGWEBHOOKS

  - **true**: **(Default)** Incoming webhooks are allowed. To manage incoming webhooks, select **Integrations** from the Mattermost Product menu.
  - **false**: The **Integrations > Incoming Webhooks** section of the Mattermost Product menu is hidden and all incoming webhooks are disabled.


.. config:setting:: enable-outgoing-webhooks
  :displayname: Enable outgoing webhooks (Integrations)
  :systemconsole: Integrations > Integration Management
  :configjson: .ServiceSettings.EnableOutgoingWebhooks
  :environment: MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLEOUTGOINGWEBHOOKS

  - **true**: **(Default)** Outgoing webhooks will be allowed. To manage outgoing webhooks, select **Integrations** from the Mattermost Product menu.
  - **false**: The **Integrations > Outgoing Webhooks** of the Mattermost Product menu is hidden and all outgoing webhooks are disabled.


.. note::

  Disabling this configuration setting in larger deployments may improve server performance in the following areas:

  - Reduced Network Traffic: Outgoing webhooks generate network requests to external services. Disabling them reduces the amount of traffic and resource usage related to those requests.
  - Decreased Load on Server: Handling webhook events and managing connections to external services uses server resources. By disabling outgoing webhooks, the server workload is reduced, allowing it to allocate more resources to other important tasks.
  - Improved Response Time: When outgoing webhooks are enabled, the server waits for the external services to return responses, potentially slowing down the performance if the external services are slow or unresponsive. Disabling them removes this dependency, leading to faster response times for user requests.
  - Lower Memory Usage: Webhooks need memory to process and store data about the requests and responses. Disabling them can free up memory which can be used to improve overall server performance.
  - Simplified Error Handling: Managing errors and retries for outgoing webhook failures can add complexity and overhead. Disabling outgoing webhooks can simplify error handling and reduce the processing overhead associated with it.
  - However, outgoing webhooks are often essential for integrating Mattermost with other services and workflows. Itâ€™s important to balance performance improvements with the needs of your organization and users.
