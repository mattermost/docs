.. tip::

  From Mattermost v10.9, you can toggle between JSON and plain text server logs in the System Console when console log output is configured as :ref:`JSON <configure/environment-configuration-settings:output console logs as json>` by specifying the log format as **JSON** or **Plain text**. This option is located in the top right corner of the page **Server logs** page.
