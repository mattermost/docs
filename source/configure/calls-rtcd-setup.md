# RTCD Setup and Configuration

```{include} ../_static/badges/calls-rtcd-ent-only.md
```

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up, configuring, and validating a Mattermost Calls deployment using the dedicated RTCD service.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying RTCD, ensure you have:

- A Mattermost Enterprise license
- A server or VM with sufficient CPU and network capacity (see the [Performance](calls-deployment.html#performance) section for sizing guidance)

## Network Requirements

The following network connectivity is required:

<style>
  table.network-requirements {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
    font-size: 0.95em;
  }
  table.network-requirements th, table.network-requirements td {
    border: 1px solid #888;
    padding: 6px 8px;
    vertical-align: top;
  }
  /* Dark mode border color */

## Installation and Deployment

There are multiple ways to deploy RTCD, depending on your environment. We recommend the following order based on production readiness and operational control:

### Bare Metal or VM Deployment (Recommended)

This is the recommended deployment method for non-Kubernetes production environments as it provides the best performance and operational control. For Kubernetes deployments, see the [Calls Deployment on Kubernetes](calls-kubernetes.md) guide.

1. **Download and install the RTCD binary**:

   Download the latest release from the [RTCD GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattermost/rtcd/releases):

   ```bash
   # Create the RTCD directory structure
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/rtcd

   # Download the latest RTCD binary (adjust URL for your architecture)
   # For Linux x86_64:
   wget https://github.com/mattermost/rtcd/releases/latest/download/rtcd-linux-amd64
   
   # Make the binary executable and move it to the installation directory
   chmod +x rtcd-linux-amd64
   sudo mv rtcd-linux-amd64 /opt/rtcd/rtcd
   ```

   ```{note}
   Replace `rtcd-linux-amd64` with the appropriate binary for your system architecture (e.g., `rtcd-linux-arm64` for ARM64 systems). The binary should be placed at `/opt/rtcd/rtcd` as this is the expected location referenced in systemd service files and other documentation.
   ```

2. **Create a configuration file** (`/opt/rtcd/rtcd.toml`) with the following settings:

   ```toml
   [api]
   http.listen_address = ":8045"
   security.allow_self_registration = true

   [rtc]
   ice_address_udp = ""
   ice_port_udp = 8443
   ice_address_tcp = ""
   ice_port_tcp = 8443
   ice_host_override = "YOUR_RTCD_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP"

   # UDP port range for WebRTC connections
   ice.port_range.min = 9000
   ice.port_range.max = 10000

   # STUN/TURN server configuration
   ice_servers = [
     { urls = ["stun:stun.global.calls.mattermost.com:3478"] }
   ]

   [store]
   data_source = "/opt/rtcd/data/db"

   [logger]
   enable_console = true
   console_json = true
   console_level = "INFO"
   enable_file = true
   file_json = true
   file_level = "INFO"
   file_location = "/opt/rtcd/rtcd.log"
   enable_color = true
   ```

3. Create a dedicated user for the RTCD service:

   ```bash
   sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /bin/false mattermost
   ```

4. Create the data directory and set ownership:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/rtcd/data/db
   sudo chown -R mattermost:mattermost /opt/rtcd
   ```

5. Create a systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/rtcd.service`):

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Mattermost RTCD Server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=mattermost
   Group=mattermost
   ExecStart=/opt/rtcd/rtcd --config /opt/rtcd/rtcd.toml
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10
   LimitNOFILE=65536

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

5. Enable and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable rtcd
   sudo systemctl start rtcd
   ```

6. Check the service status:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status rtcd
   ```

### Docker Deployment

Docker deployment is suitable for development, testing, or containerized production environments:

1. Run the RTCD container with basic configuration:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name rtcd \
     -e "RTCD_LOGGER_ENABLEFILE=true" \
     -e "RTCD_API_SECURITY_ALLOWSELFREGISTRATION=true" \
     -p 8443:8443/udp \
     -p 8443:8443/tcp \
     -p 8045:8045/tcp \
     mattermost/rtcd:latest
   ```

2. For debugging purposes, you can enable more detailed logging:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name rtcd \
     -e "RTCD_LOGGER_ENABLEFILE=true" \
     -e "RTCD_LOGGER_CONSOLELEVEL=DEBUG" \
     -e "RTCD_API_SECURITY_ALLOWSELFREGISTRATION=true" \
     -p 8443:8443/udp \
     -p 8443:8443/tcp \
     -p 8045:8045/tcp \
     mattermost/rtcd:latest
   ```

   To view the logs:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f rtcd
   ```

You can also use a mounted configuration file instead of environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d --name rtcd \
  -p 8045:8045 \
  -p 8443:8443/udp \
  -p 8443:8443/tcp \
  -v /path/to/config.toml:/rtcd/config/config.toml \
  mattermost/rtcd:latest
```

For a complete sample configuration file, see the [RTCD config.sample.toml](https://github.com/mattermost/rtcd/blob/master/config/config.sample.toml) in the official repository.

### Kubernetes Deployment

For Kubernetes deployments, use the official Helm chart:

1. Add the Mattermost Helm repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add mattermost https://helm.mattermost.com
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Install the RTCD chart:

   ```bash
   helm install mattermost-rtcd mattermost/mattermost-rtcd \
     --set ingress.enabled=true \
     --set ingress.host=rtcd.example.com \
     --set service.annotations."service\\.beta\\.kubernetes\\.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol"=udp \
     --set rtcd.ice.hostOverride=rtcd.example.com
   ```

   Refer to the [RTCD Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-helm/tree/master/charts/mattermost-rtcd) for additional configuration options.

## Configuration

### RTCD Configuration File

The RTCD service uses a TOML configuration file. Here's an example with commonly used settings:

```toml
[api]
# The address and port to which the HTTP API server will listen
http.listen_address = ":8045"
# Security settings for authentication
security.allow_self_registration = true
security.enable_admin = true
security.admin_secret_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

[rtc]
# The UDP address and port for media traffic
ice_address_udp = ""
ice_port_udp = 8443
# The TCP address and port for fallback connections 
ice_address_tcp = ""
ice_port_tcp = 8443
# Public hostname or IP that clients will use to connect
ice_host_override = "RTCD_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP"

[logger]
# Logging configuration
enable_console = true
console_json = false
console_level = "INFO"
enable_file = true
file_json = true
file_level = "INFO"
file_location = "/opt/rtcd/rtcd.log"
```

Key Configuration Options:

- **api.http.listen_address**: The address and port where the RTCD HTTP API service listens
- **rtc.ice_address_udp**: The UDP address for media traffic (empty means listen on all interfaces)
- **rtc.ice_port_udp**: The UDP port for media traffic 
- **rtc.ice_address_tcp**: The TCP address for fallback media traffic
- **rtc.ice_port_tcp**: The TCP port for fallback media traffic
- **rtc.ice_host_override**: The public hostname or IP address clients will use to connect to RTCD
- **api.security.admin_secret_key**: API key for Mattermost servers to authenticate with RTCD

### Required Mattermost Server Configuration

When using RTCD, you must configure the Mattermost server's CORS settings to allow proper communication between the server and the RTCD service.

#### CORS Configuration

The `AllowCorsFrom` setting must include your SiteURL and, if using calls-offloader in a private network, the Mattermost server's private IP address:

**Using mmctl:**
```bash
# Basic RTCD configuration - include your SiteURL
mmctl config set ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom "https://your-domain.com"

# If using calls-offloader in a private network, also include Mattermost's private IP with port 8065
mmctl config set ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom "https://your-domain.com http://192.168.1.100:8065"
```

**Using System Console:**
1. Go to **System Console > Environment > Web Server**
2. Set **Allow cross-origin requests from** to include:
   - Your SiteURL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com`)
   - If using calls-offloader in a private network: Also include Mattermost's private IP with port 8065 (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8065`)

**Using config.json:**
```json
{
  "ServiceSettings": {
    "AllowCorsFrom": "https://your-domain.com http://192.168.1.100:8065"
  }
}
```

```{important}
This CORS configuration is specifically required for RTCD deployments and is not needed for integrated mode deployments. Multiple origins should be separated by spaces.
```

### STUN/TURN Configuration

For clients behind strict firewalls, you may need to configure STUN/TURN servers. In the RTCD configuration file, reference your STUN/TURN servers as follows:

```toml
[rtc]
# STUN/TURN server configuration
   ice_servers = [
     { urls = ["stun:stun.global.calls.mattermost.com:3478"] }
   #  { urls = ["turn:turn.example.com:3478"], username = "turnuser", credential = "turnpassword" }
   ]

```

We recommend using [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) for your TURN server implementation. 

### System Tuning

For high-volume deployments, tune your Linux system:

1. Add the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

   ```bash
   # Increase UDP buffer sizes
   net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
   net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
   net.core.optmem_max = 16777216
   ```

2. Apply the settings:

   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

## Validation and Testing

After deploying RTCD, validate the installation:

1. **Check service status and version**:

   ```bash
   curl http://YOUR_RTCD_SERVER:8045/version
   # Should return a JSON object with service information
   # Example: {"build_hash":"abc123","build_date":"2023-01-15T12:00:00Z","build_version":"0.11.0","goVersion":"go1.20.4"}
   ```

2. **Test UDP connectivity**:

   On the RTCD server:
   
   ```bash
   nc -l -u -p 8443
   ```

   On a client machine:
   
   ```bash
   nc -v -u YOUR_RTCD_SERVER 8443
   ```
      
   Type a message and hit Enter on either side. If messages are received on both ends, UDP connectivity is working.

   Note: This test must be run with the RTCD service stopped, as it binds to the same port.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop rtcd
   ```

3. **Test TCP connectivity** (if enabled):

   Similar to the UDP test, but remove the `-u` flag from both commands.

4. **Monitor metrics**:

   Refer to [Calls Metrics and Monitoring](calls-metrics-monitoring.md) for setting up Calls metrics and monitoring.

## Horizontal Scaling

To scale RTCD horizontally:

1. **Deploy multiple RTCD instances**:
   
   Deploy multiple RTCD servers, each with their own unique IP address.

2. **Configure DNS-based load balancing**:
   
   Set up a DNS record that points to multiple RTCD IP addresses:
   
   ```bash
   rtcd.example.com.    IN A    10.0.0.1
   rtcd.example.com.    IN A    10.0.0.2
   rtcd.example.com.    IN A    10.0.0.3
   ```

3. **Configure health checks**:
   
   Set up health checks to automatically remove unhealthy RTCD instances from DNS.

4. **Configure Mattermost**:
   
   In the Mattermost System Console, set the **RTCD Service URL** to your DNS name (e.g., `rtcd.example.com`).

The Mattermost Calls plugin will distribute calls among the available RTCD hosts. Remember that a single call will always be hosted on one RTCD instance; sessions belonging to the same call are not spread across different instances.

## Integration with Mattermost

Once RTCD is properly set up and validated, configure Mattermost to use it:

1. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Calls**

2. Enable the **Enable RTCD Service** option

3. Set the **RTCD Service URL** to your RTCD service address (either a single server or DNS load-balanced hostname)

4. If configured, enter the **RTCD API Key** that matches the one in your RTCD configuration

5. Save the configuration

6. Test by creating a new call in any Mattermost channel

7. Verify that the call is being routed through RTCD by checking the RTCD logs and metrics
