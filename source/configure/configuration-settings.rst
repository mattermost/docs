Configuration settings
======================

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

System Admins for both self-hosted and Cloud Mattermost workspaces can manage Mattermost configuration using the System Console. For self-hosted deployments, admins can additionally edit the ``config.json`` file. 

.. note::
  
  Mattermost requires write permissions to the ``config.json`` file; otherwise, configuration changes made within the System Console will have no effect.

Mattermost configuration settings are organized into the following categories within the System Console:

- :doc:`Self-hosted workspace edition and license settings </configure/self-hosted-account-settings>`
- :doc:`Cloud workspace subscription, billing, and account settings</configure/cloud-billing-account-settings>`
- :doc:`Reporting configuration settings </configure/reporting-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`User management configuration settings </configure/user-management-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Environment configuration settings </configure/environment-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Site configuration settings </configure/site-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Authentication configuration settings </configure/authentication-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Plugins configuration settings </configure/plugins-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Integrations configuration settings </configure/integrations-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Compliance configuration settings </configure/compliance-configuration-settings>`
- :doc:`Experimental configuration settings </configure/experimental-configuration-settings>`

In self-hosted Mattermost deployments, configuration settings are maintained in the ``config.json`` configuration file, located in the ``mattermost/config`` directory, or `stored in the database <https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuation-in-a-database.html>`__. System Admins managing self-hosted workspaces can also modify the ``config.json`` file directly using a text editor.

Configuration in database
--------------------------

.. include:: ../_static/badges/selfhosted-only.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

Self-hosted system configuration can be stored in the database. This changes the Mattermost binary from reading the default ``config.json`` file to reading the configuration settings stored within a configuration table in the database. See the `Mattermost database configuration </configure/configuation-in-a-database.html>`__ documentation for migration details.

Environment variables
---------------------

.. include:: ../_static/badges/selfhosted-only.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

You can use :doc:`environment variables </configure/environment-variables>` to manage Mattermost configuration. Environment variables override settings in ``config.json``. If a change to a setting in ``config.json`` requires a restart to take effect, then changes to the corresponding environment variable also require a server restart. 

Configuration reload
--------------------

.. include:: ../_static/badges/selfhosted-only.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

The “config watcher”, the mechanism that automatically reloads the ``config.json`` file, has been deprecated in favor of the `mmctl config reload <https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html#mmctl-config-reload>`__ command that you must run to apply configuration changes you've made. This improves configuration performance and robustness.

Deprecated configuration settings
---------------------------------

See the :doc:`deprecated configuration settings documentation </configure/deprecated-configuration-settings>` for details on all deprecated Mattermost configuration settings that are no longer supported.
