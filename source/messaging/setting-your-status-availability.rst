Let your team know whether you're available by setting a custom status and your availability in Mattermost.

Setting a custom status
-----------------------

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Mattermost v6.0 onwards

      In Mattermost v6.0, set status and availability from your Avatar in the top-right corner of the Global Header.
      
  .. tab:: Mattermost v5.39 and earlier

      In Mattermost versions up to 5.39, set status and availability from your avatar at the top of the channel sidebar.
  
Set a custom status to add an optional emoji to a descriptive status message. Other members can see your status anywhere they can see your name, such as the channel sidebar and in conversations.Â

Setting your availability
-------------------------

To set your availability, select your Avatar, then specify your availability as  **Online**,Â **Away**,Â **Do Not Disturb**, orÂ **Offline**.

  :alt: Set your availability to online, away, do not disturb, or offline.

When you set your availability, an availability icon displays next to your name. Setting your availability as **Do Not Disturb**Â automatically disables desktop, email, and push notifications.

Other members can see your availability anywhere they can see your name, such as the channel sidebar, within conversations, and within Direct Messages.Â
