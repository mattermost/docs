It's also possible to `create your own custom emoji <#custom-emoji>`_ if the emoji you want to use doesn't exist.

Creating Custom Emojis
-----------------------
  
You can create Custom Emojis which are available to everyone on your Mattermost server. From the Emoji Picker, select **Custom Emoji**. Small, square pictures work best when selecting an image to upload. The file can be any JPG, GIF, or PNG and up to 1 MB in size.
  
1. Enter a name for your Custom Emoji. This is the name that will show up in the emoji autocomplete.
2. Choose **Select**, then select the image to use for the emoji. 
3. Select **Save**.

Once saved, your emoji is added to the list of Custom Emoji. 

.. note::

  If you can't see the **Custom Emoji** option, then your Mattermost System Admin may have restricted access to certain users. Contact your Mattermost System Admin for help.
