Signing In
==========

To sign in, navigate to the Mattermost sign-in screen. You'll receive a Mattermost URL from your System Admin or from an email invitation.

.. tip::
  We recommend bookmarking the Mattermost URL provided by your System Admin or through an email invitation so signing in to Mattermost is easy in the future.

After signing in, the team that appears first on your team sidebar will open. If you have not joined a team, the Team Selection page opens where you can view a list of teams that you can join.

Email Address or Username Sign In
---------------------------------

When enabled by your System Admin, you can sign in with the username or email address used to create your account.

If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by selecting **I forgot my password** on the sign-in screen, or contact your System Admin for help resetting your password.
