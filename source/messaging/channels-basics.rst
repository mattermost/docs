Notify teammates
----------------

Let teammates know when they're needed by typing ``@username``.

Link to Channels
----------------

Create a link to a Public Channel in a message by typing ``~`` followed by the channel name (e.g. ``~roadmap``). From Mattermost v6.2, channel members also see Private Channel names returned.

Format your messages
--------------------

Format your messages using Markdown that supports text styling, headings, links, emojis, code blocks, block quotes, tables, lists, and in-line images.

You can use either ``_`` or ``*`` for italics and bold text.

See our `Formatting Text <https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html>`__ documentation for more details and examples.

React to messages
-----------------

React to messages quickly by selecting the |smile-icon| icon inside the Mattermost message input box to open the Emoji Picker.

.. |smile-icon| image:: ../images/smile-icon.png
  :alt: Smile icon.

Or, react to messages by typing ":" followed by two characters, which will open an emoji autocomplete. If the existing emojis don't cover what you want to express, you can also create your own `Custom Emoji <https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/using-emoji.html#creating-custom-emojis>`__.

Share files
-----------

Share files by dragging and dropping them into Channels, or by selecting the |attachment-icon| icon within the message input box.

.. |attachment-icon| image:: ../images/attachment-icon.png
  :alt: Attachment icon.

Save messages for follow up
---------------------------

Save messages for later follow up by selecting the |save-icon| icon next to the message.
