Sharing Messages
================

You can share links to messages in Mattermost. Select the **More Actions** option next to a message, then select **Copy Link**. Paste the link into a message to share the link with others.

Sharing links to messages generates a preview of the message which helps minimize context switching. 

Previews respect channel membership permissions, so theyâ€™re only visible to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a message in a Public Channel, any member of the team can see the message preview. If the link is to a message in a Private Channel or Direct Message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.

.. tip::

    The timestamp next to the username of any message also functions as a permanent link to that conversation.
