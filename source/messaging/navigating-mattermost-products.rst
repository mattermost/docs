Navigating Mattermost Products
==============================

In Mattermost v6.0, we’ve introduced enhancements  to the user experience with a new global navigation header. 

The Global Header introduces a new way of navigating and using Mattermost, and offers shared functionality available across the product suite in a single place. If you’ve recently installed or upgraded to v6.0, you’ll notice that Account Settings options have been split up, the Search bar is now front and center, and we’ve introduced a tool switcher for easy navigation between Channels, Boards, and Playbooks.

If you’re new to Mattermost, this document will help you start using these new Global Header features.

While Channels, Boards, and Playbooks  feature unique functionality within the Global Header, the following features are shared across all three products:

Account Settings
Status and Availability
Settings (different options for each tool)
Product Menu button

In addition to this documentation, take a look at the Mattermost onboarding tips/tutorials.

Account Settings
----------------

Account Settings is accessible from the top-right corner of the Global Header. Select your avatar image, then choose Account Settings. From here, you can configure your profile settings and security settings. 

Status and Availability
-----------------------

Let your team know your online status using status and availability settings. Select your avatar in the top-right corner to change your status and availability. 

Product switcher
----------------

In the top-left corner of the Global Header, select the Product Menu button to open the tool switcher to switch between Channels, Playbooks, and Boards.

Depending on permissions set for your Mattermost , this is where you would also find Mattermost Integrations, System Console, and Marketplace menu links. You’ll always be able to view the version information of your Mattermost workspace.

History arrows
--------------

Use the arrows to the right of the tool switcher to show the last channel/next channel.
