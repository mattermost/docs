## Integrations

Settings for integrations are accessible from the **Main Menu**. Select **Integrations** to open a page where you can view and configure incoming webhooks, outgoing webhooks, and slash commands for your team. If you can't see an **Integrations** option, then your System Admin may have only given Admins access.

[Visit our Marketplace](https://mattermost.com/marketplace/) for dozens of open source integrations to common tools like Jira, Jenkins, GitLab, Trac, Redmine, and Bitbucket, along with interactive bot applications (Hubot, mattermost-bot), and other communication tools (Email, IRC, XMPP, Threema) that are freely available for use and customization.
