Mattermost Channels are communication workflows that offer channel-based real-time and asynchronous collaboration through a modern, digital workspace that will help you be more productive in your day-to-day work life.

Some of the major benefits of using Channels include:

- All your team communication is in one place with channels for topic-based, group-based, or meeting-based project collaboration.
- Integrated voice, video, file, and link sharing.
- Removes information and organizational silos with Direct 1:1, Group Messaging, as well as site-wide search.
- Markdown and code syntax highlighting.
- Persistent communication history.
