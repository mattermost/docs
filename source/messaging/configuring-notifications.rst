Notifications in Mattermost alert you to unread messages and mentions. Desktop, email, and mobile push notifications notify you of activity in Mattermost. 

You can configure your Mattermost account for how and when you want to be notified of Mattermost activity. When you join a team, Mattermost will notify you of messages directed at you, including when someone:

- Mentions you specifically with `@username`
- Sends you a Direct Message
- Mentions your username or first name in a channel
- Notifies a channel you're in using @channel or @all
- Responds to a thread you're following
- Uses any `keywords you've configured <https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/managing-account-settings.html#words-that-trigger-mentions>`_ 

Desktop Notifications
----------------------

Desktop notifications are pop-ups that appear in the corner of your main monitor when using Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, or the `Mattermost Desktop Apps <https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`_. You can change the default preference to trigger desktop notifications for all messages sent in channels you're a member of, or turn them off entirely. You can also choose what sound plays when a desktop notification is triggered on supported browsers and the Mattermost Desktop Apps.

Browser tab notifications
-------------------------

If Mattermost is open in a browser tab, the favicon updates to notify you of unread messages (\*) and a count of mentions or Direct Messages. Browser tab notifications are available on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari.

Muting a channel
----------------

Channels in the sidebar are **bold** when there are unread messages in the channel and show a badge count if you are mentioned specifically. 

When you mute a channel, you do not receive any notifications (desktop, email, or push) for any mentions (whether they are channel-wide or directed at you). However, if you are mentioned while the channel is muted, the mention badge will be displayed in the sidebar with the channel displaying at reduced opacity.

To mute a channel, click on the channel name and select **Mute Channel**. To unmute it, click on the channel name and select **Unmute Channel**.

.. tip:: 

  Mentions are triggered by `selected keywords <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#words-that-trigger-mentions>`__. Learn more about `mentioning teammates <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/mentioning-teammates.html>`__.

Ignoring mentions
-----------------

To turn off notifications for channel-wide mentions for @channel, @here, and @all, navigate to:

**Notification Preferences > Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all**. Choose **Edit**, select **On**, and then select **Save**. 

When this setting is on you will still receive notifications for direct mentions. 

**Note:** If you've muted a channel and also enabled **Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all** then you will not receive any notifications (whether they're direct or channel-wide). However, if you are directly mentioned in the muted channel a badge counter will be displayed in the sidebar. 

You can also view the `notifications flow charts <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/faq.html?#notifications>`_ for more information about notification behavior in Mattermost.
