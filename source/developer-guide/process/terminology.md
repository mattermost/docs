# Terminology 

Mattermost terminology used across the project. 

#### 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5 

We use "x/5" to concisely communicate conviction. 0/5 means you don't have a strong opinion, you are just sharing an idea or asking a question. 5/5 means you are highly confident and would stake your reputation on the opinion you're expressing. 

#### APR

Acronym for [Accepting Pull Request](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/accepting-pull-request.html) tickets, which are vetted changes to the source code open for community contributions.  

#### Bug

An obvious error in Mattermost software. Changes required to accomodate unsupported 3rd party software (such as browsers or operating systems) are not considered bugs, they are considered improvements. 

#### Dev Mana

A specific type of mana for developers similar to "points" or "jelly beans" in an Agile/Scrum methodology. On average, full time Mattermost developers each complete tickets adding up to approximately 28 mana per week. A "small" item is 2 mana, a "medium" is 4, a "large" is 8 and any project bigger needs to be broken down into smaller tickets. 

#### FX Guidelines

Short for "Fan eXperience Guidelines" defining usability requirements to turn users into fans.

#### Improvement 

A beneficial change to code that is not fixing a bug. 

#### LHS

The "Left-Hand Sidebar" in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.

#### Mana

An estimate of total energy, attention and effort required for a task. 

A one-line change to code can cost more mana than a 100-line change due to risk and the need for documentation, testing, support and all the other activities needed. 

Every feature added has an initial and on-going mana cost, which is taken into account in feature decsions. 

#### RHS

The "Right-Hand Sidebar" in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.
