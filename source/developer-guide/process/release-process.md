# Release Process

Mattermost core team works on a monthly release process, with a new version shipping on the 16th of each month in [binary form](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#mattermost-team-edition). 

This document outlines the development process for the Mattermost core team, which draws from what we find works best for us from Agile, Scrum and Software Development Lifecycle approaches.

## Release Timeline
