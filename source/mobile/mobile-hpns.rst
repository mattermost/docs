Hosted Push Notification Service
================================

Securing your Mattermost Push Notification Service
--------------------------------------------------

When using Mattermost mobile apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play, purchase an annual subscription to `Mattermost Enterprise Edition E10 <https://about.mattermost.com/pricing/>`_ or higher to receive access to our Hosted Push Notification Service (HPNS).

Our Hosted Push Notification Service offers:

  - Access to a publicly-hosted Mattermost Push Notification Service (MPNS) offering an explicit privacy policy where the contents of unencrypted messages are not examined or stored
  - Encrypted TLS connections between HPNS and Apple Push Notification Services, HPNS and Googleâ€™s Firebase Cloud Messaging service, and HPNS and your Mattermost server
  - Production-level uptime expectation

After purchasing a subscription to Mattermost E10 or higher from Mattermost, Inc. follow the instructions below to set up and test your system.

.. Note:: Mattermost, Inc. also offers a free basic hosted service for testing setups called the Test Push Notification Service (TPNS). It does not offer a production-level uptime expectation, nor does it offer encrypted transport.

Both TPNS and HPNS only work with the Mattermost Apple App Store and Google Play apps. If you have compiled the apps yourselves, you must also host your own Mattermost push proxy server. See our FAQ on :ref:`how push notifications work <push-faq>` for more details.
