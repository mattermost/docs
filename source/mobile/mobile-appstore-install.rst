Install from Apple App Store and Google Play
============================================

To deploy the apps hosted in the Apple App Store and Google Play, we recommend you take the following steps to secure your deployment:

1. Set up a way to connect to your private network Mattermost instance, using:
  - An external proxy with encrypted transport through HTTPS and WSS network connections
  - (Optional) A mobile VPN client
  - Note: If a mobile VPN client with multi-factor authentication is not used, we recommend requiring multi-factor authentication through Mattermost Enterprise Edition or your SSO provider

2. Enable mobile push notifications
  - Go to **System Console > Notifications > Mobile Push**
  - If testing the apps, or using Team Edition: Select "Use iOS and Android apps on iTunes and Google Play with TPNS"
  - If using the apps in production with Enterprise Edition: Select "Use encrypted, production-quality HPNS connection to iOS and Android apps"

3. (Optional) Customize mobile push notification contents
  - Go to **System Console** > **Notifications** > **Mobile Push**
  - Select what type of information to include in push notifications
  - Most deployments choose to include the full message snippet in push notifications unless they have policies against it to protect confidential information

4. Download the mobile applications to your mobile device:

  - `iOS App <https://about.mattermost.com/mattermost-ios-app/>`_
  - `Android App <https://about.mattermost.com/mattermost-android-app/>`_

5. Open the mobile application and enter the address of your Mattermost server to connect
