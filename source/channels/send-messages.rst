.. tip::
  
  - When you send messages in a channel, depending on the `channel actions configured </channels/create-channels.html>`__, specific words in the post can trigger a prompt to run a playbook. Access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.
  - Using a RTL plugin, Mattermost can automatically detect and display messages written using right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian. Your System Admin must install the `RTL Plugin <https://github.com/QueraTeam/mattermost-rtl>`__ to enable this functionality.
  - `Mattermost Professional or Enterprise <https://mattermost.com/pricing>`__ customers can `edit or delete messages <#edit-or-delete-messages>`__ after sending them if the System Admin hasn't restricted the ability to do so using `advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.
  
Draft messages
--------------

From Mattermost v7.7, when composing new messages, it's easy to return to a message in progress later. Draft messages are added to a **Drafts** view available at the top of the channel sidebar

  :alt: Global drafts makes it easy for you to find all messages in progress.

By default, message drafts are synchronized on the Mattermost server and are accessible everywhere you access Mattermost, including a web browser or the desktop app with mobile support coming in a future release. 

.. Tip::
  
  You can disable server-synchronized drafts and limit drafts to your current Mattermost client only by going to **Settings > Advanced > Allow message drafts to sync with the server**.
  
.. note::

  To disable global drafts, system admins can set the feature flag ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_GLOBALDRAFTS`` to ``false`` to disable it server-wide. It can't be disabled on a per-user basis. The code is located `here <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/model/feature_flags.go#L11>`_.

Edit or delete messages
-----------------------

Select the **More** |more-icon| icon next to a message that you've sent.

.. image:: ../images/more-actions.png
   :alt: Select the More option to edit or delete a sent message.

Select **Edit** to edit your own messages. Editing a message won't trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications, or notification sounds.

Select **Delete** to delete your own messages. Select **Delete** again to confirm.

From Mattermost v7.9, you can view the edit history of an edited message and restore a previous version of an edited message.

- **To view edit history:** Hover over the word *Edited* next to your edited message. In the right-hand sidebar, you'll see all previous versions of the message.
- **To restore a message:** Select the icon in the top-right corner of the message you want to restore and confirm the action.
