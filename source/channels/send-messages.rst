Compose a message by typing into the text box at the bottom of the Mattermost screen. Send your message by selecting **Send** |send-icon|. 

`Mattermost Professional or Enterprise <https://mattermost.com/pricing>`__ customers can `edit or delete messages <#edit-or-delete-messages>`__ after sending them if the system admin hasn't restricted the ability to do so using `advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.

.. tip::
  
  - You can use keyboard shortcuts to send messages. Press :kbd:`Enter` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`↵` on Mac, to send the message. To create new lines of text without sending, press :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`Enter` on Windows or Linux, or press :kbd:`⇧` :kbd:`↵` on Mac. If you prefer to send messages using :kbd:`Ctrl`/:kbd:`⌘`, you can set this preference in **Settings** by going to **Advanced > Send messages on CTRL+ENTER**. How you access settings depends on the version of Mattermost you're using. See the `what's changed in Mattermost v6.0 </welcome/what-changed-in-v60.html#account-settings>`__ documentation for details. 
  - When you send messages in a channel, depending on the `channel actions configured </channels/create-channels.html>`__, specific words in the post can trigger a prompt to run a playbook. Access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.
  - Using a RTL plugin, Mattermost can automatically detect and display messages written using right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian. Your System Admin must install the `RTL Plugin <https://github.com/QueraTeam/mattermost-rtl>`__ to enable this functionality.
