Save and pin messages
=====================

You have two ways to mark a post to make it easy to find later: `saving messages <#save-messages>`__ and `pinning messages <#pin-messages>`__. 

- Saving a message saves it for only you. 
- Pinning a message marks it for an entire channel.

Save messages
--------------

Save messages for later follow up by selecting the **Save** |save-icon| icon next to a message.
