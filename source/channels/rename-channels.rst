Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the System Admin has `restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Web browser/Desktop app

     **Rename a channel in desktop app**

        Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Rename Channel**. You'll be prompted for two values:

        - **Channel display name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface. 
        - **Channel handle:** This is part of the channel URL. You can also change the channel handle when renaming a channel, but changing channel handles may break existing links.

        For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display name would be ``UX Design``, and the channel handle would be ``ux-design``.


  .. tab:: Mobile app

     **Rename a channel in the mobile app v2**

     In the mobile app, select the channel name from the sidebar to access the menu, then select **Edit Channel**. You'll be promoted for three values:
     
     - **Name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface.
     
     - **Purpose:** This  is optional and can be used to describe the channel's function or goal. This is optional.
     - **Header:** This is also optional as well and may include information relevant to the channel, such as useful contacts or documents. This is optional.

     For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display **Name** would be ``UX Design``,and for  the optional ones like **purpose** is to discuss about UX by core contributors and staff and the otherone is  **Header** is the links and repos listed under Header option.
