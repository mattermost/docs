Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the System Admin has `restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Web browser/desktop app

        Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Rename Channel**. You'll be prompted two provide two pieces of information:

        - **Channel display name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface. 
        - **Channel handle:** This is part of the channel URL. You can also change the channel handle when renaming a channel, but changing channel handles may break existing links.

        For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display name would be ``UX Design``, and the channel handle would be ``ux-design``.

  .. tab:: Mobile app

    1. Select the channel you want to rename.
    2. Select the **More** |more-icon| icon located in the top right corner of the app.
    3. Select **View info**.
    4. Select **Edit Channel**.
    5. You're prompted to provide three pieces of information:

      - **Name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface.
      - **Purpose:** (Optional) Used to describe the channel's function or goal.
      - **Header:** (Optional) Used to include information relevant to the channel, such as key contacts or document links.
