Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the System Admin has `restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Web browser/desktop app

     **Rename a channel**

        Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Rename Channel**. You'll be prompted for two values:

        - **Channel display name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface. 
        - **Channel handle:** This is part of the channel URL. You can also change the channel handle when renaming a channel, but changing channel handles may break existing links.

        For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display name would be ``UX Design``, and the channel handle would be ``ux-design``.

  .. tab:: Mobile app

     **Rename a channel in the mobile app v2**

     In the mobile app, select the channel name from the sidebar to access the menu, then select **Edit Channel**. You'll be promoted for three values:
     
     - **Name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface.
     - **Purpose:** This is optional can be used to describe the channel's function or goal.
     - **Header:** This is optional and may include information relevant to the channel, such as useful contacts or documents.
