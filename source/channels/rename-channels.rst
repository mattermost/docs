Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the System Admin has `restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.

      **Rename a channel**

        In the desktop app, select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Rename Channel**. You'll be prompted for two values:

        - **Channel display name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface. 
        - **Channel handle:** This is part of the channel URL. You can also change the channel handle when renaming a channel, but changing channel handles may break existing links.

        For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display name would be ``UX Design``, and the channel handle would be ``ux-design``.

        **To Rename  channel in the mobile app V2**

           In the mobile app, select the channel name from the sidebar to access the menu, then select **Edit Channel** option. There will be three values:
           - **Name:** you can give a suitable name which will appear in the Mattermost user interface.
           - **Purpose:** you can write the motive of the channel.
           - **Header:** This may include information relevant to the channel, such as useful contacts or documents. This is optional.

           For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display **Name** would be ``UX Design``,             **purpose** is to discuss about UX by core contributors and staff, **Header** is the links and repos listed under Header option.
