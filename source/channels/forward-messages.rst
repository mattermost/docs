  :alt: Use the More icon to access additional message options.

To forward messages in Mattermost, select the **More** |more-icon| icon next to a message, then select **Forward**. Specify where you want to forward the message, and include an optional comment. Forwarding messages generates a preview of the message.

.. image:: ../images/permalink-previews.png
   :alt: Mattermost generates previews of links shared in Channels.

Previews respect channel membership permissions, so theyâ€™re only visible to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a message in a public channel, any member of the team can see the message preview. If the link is to a message in a private channel or direct message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.
