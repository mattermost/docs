Forward messages

From Mattermost v7.2, using a web browser or the desktop app, you can forward messages in Mattermost to another channel by selecting the **More** |more-icon| icon next to a message, then selecting **Forward**. From Mattermost v7.5, you can also forward messages from bots and webhooks.

  :alt: You can forward messages to others using the More option.

Specify where you want to forward the message, and include an optional comment. Forwarding messages generates a preview of the message.

   :alt: Mattermost generates previews of links shared in Channels.

Previews respect channel membership permissions, so theyâ€™re only visible to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a message in a public channel, any member of the team can see the message preview. If the link is to a message in a private channel or direct message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.
