You can share links to Mattermost messages with other Mattermost users. Sharing message links displays a preview of the message in the post. The timestamp next to the username of any message also functions as a permanent link to that conversation.

.. note::
  
  Message previews respect channel membership permissions, so theyâ€™re only visible to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a message in a public channel, any member of the team can see the message preview. If the link is to a message in a private channel or direct message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.
