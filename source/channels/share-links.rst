Paste the link into a message to share the image link with others. Sharing links to messages generates a preview of the message.

   :alt: Mattermost generates previews of links shared in Channels.

.. tip::
  
  You can also hover over an image and select the |copy-link-icon| icon in the top right corner. 

Previews respect channel membership permissions, so they’re only visible to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a message in a public channel, any member of the team can see the message preview. If the link is to a message in a private channel or direct message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.

.. tip::

    The timestamp next to the username of any message also functions as a permanent link to that conversation.
