Mattermost calls is built-in voice calling and screen sharing functionality, available in Channels. It’s available and on by default in Mattermost Cloud. For self-hosted deployments it's available as a plugin and needs to be enabled.

You can:

- Start or join a call in any channel, group message, or direct message that you’re a part of.
- Use Calls on desktop and mobile apps in addition to web browsers.
- Share screen (not available on mobile), raise hands, chat in a thread, and even switch between products in the Mattermost suite (ie. Channels, Boards, and Playbooks) while on a call.

How do I start a call on the desktop?
-------------------------------------

Open the channel, group message, or direct message where you’d like to have a call and then select **Start Call** on the top-right corner.

How do I start a call on the mobile app?
----------------------------------------

Tap the channel header and select **Start Call** from the list menu.

How can I copy the call link to paste in other places such as calendar invite?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each call is unique to the channel and an access link can be generated by using the ``/call`` link slash command in the respective channel.
