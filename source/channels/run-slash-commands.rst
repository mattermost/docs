Slash commands enable you to perform operations in Mattermost by typing into the text input box. Enter a ``/`` followed by a command and some arguments to perform actions.

Built-in slash commands come with all Mattermost installations and custom slash commands are configurable to interact with external applications. See our `developer documentation <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/admin-guide/admin-slash-commands/#built-in-commands>`__ for details on built-in slash commands available in your Mattermost workspace.
