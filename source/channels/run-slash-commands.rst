Slash commands enable you to perform operations in Mattermost by typing into the text input box. Enter a ``/`` followed by a command and some arguments to perform actions.

Built-in slash commands come with all Mattermost installations and custom slash commands are configurable to interact with external applications. See our `product documentation </channels/interact-with-channels.html>`__ for details on built-in slash commands available in your Mattermost workspace. Then see our `developer documentation <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/slash-commands/custom/>`__ to learn more about configuring custom slash commands.
