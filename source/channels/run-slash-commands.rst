Mattermost slash commands offer an alternate way to perform tasks and actions in Mattermost. Slash commands are often preferred by developers and technical audiences because of how fast they are to use, and how similar they are to a developer's daily coding tools.

Using a slash command is as easy as composing a message; however, instead of message text, you start slash commands with a slash character: ``/``. For example, if you want to log out of Mattermost using only your keyboard, you can enter ``/logout`` in the message text box and select **Send**. Because your message starts with a slash ``/``, Mattermost knows it's a slash command, and performs the action defined for that command.

Mattermost comes with many built-in slash commands for common actions you can start using right away. Visit our `product documentation </channels/interact-with-channels.html>`__ to learn more.
