You can mark public channels, private channels, and direct messages as Favorite so they appear in the Favorite category in the channel sidebar.
To mark a channel as a **Favorites** one, you need to open the channel:

**On desktop:** At the top of the page, select on the star icon next to the channel name.

    :alt: Mark a channel as a favorite.
       
This adds the channel to a **Favorites** list at the top of the channel sidebar, so it's easy to access. To remove a channel from the **Favorites** list, select the star again.
