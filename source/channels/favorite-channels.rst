By deciding which public channels, private channels, and direct messages are most significant to you, you can organize your channel sidebar by marking the channels that are most important to you as **Favourites**.

To mark a channel as a **Favourites** one, you need to open the channel:

**On desktop:** At the top of the page, select on the star icon next to the channel name.

    :alt: Mark a channel as a favorite.
       
This adds the channel to a **Favourites** list at the top of the channel sidebar, so it's easy to access. To remove a channel from the **Favourites** list, select the star again.
