Add members to a channel
------------------------

Any member of a channel can add new members to a channel. Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Add Members**. Search for users, select users, then select **Add** to add them to the current channel. Mattermost notifies you when a user is already a member of the channel.

You can also add users to channels within their profile pop-over by choosing **Add to a Channel**, specifying the channel you want them to join, then selecting **Add**.
