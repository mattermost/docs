Add members to a channel
------------------------

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, any member of a channel can add other members to public or private channels, unless your System Admin has restricted access to do so. 

1. Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Add Members**.

2. Search for users, select users, then select **Add** to add users to the current channel. Mattermost notifies you when a user is already a member of the channel.

.. tip::

  - From Mattermost v7.8, people you've messaged directly are listed first, followed by all users in alphabetical order. 
  - Alternatively, to add members to a channel, select the channel name, select the **View Info** |channel-info| icon, select **Members** in the right pane, and then select **Add**.
 
Add users from their profile

You can also add users to channels within their profile pop-over.

2. Select **Add to a Channel**.
