  .. tab:: Mobile app

    1. Select the **+** symbol at the top right of the page, then select **Browse Channels** at the bottom. 

    2. Select the public channel you want to join.

.. tip::
  
  When you join channels, depending on the `channel actions configured </channels/create-channels.html>`__, you may see a welcome message, and channels may be added to `a category in your channel sidebar </channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ automatically. 
  Access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.

Leave a channel
---------------

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Web browser/Desktop app

    Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Leave Channel**. 

    .. image:: ../images/leave-channels.png
      :alt: You can use channel options available from the channel name to leave a channel.

  .. tab:: Mobile app

    Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the channel information pane, then select **Leave Channel**. 

When you leave a private channel, you must be re-added by another channel member to rejoin. You won't receive mention notifications from a channel if you're not a member of that channel.
