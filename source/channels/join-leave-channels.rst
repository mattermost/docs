Join a channel
--------------

To join a private channel, you need to be added to the channel by a member of that channel.

To join a public channel:

1. Select the **+** symbol at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**.

2. Select **Join** next to the public channel you want to join.

    :alt: When browsing available channels, select the join option next to any channel to become a member.

.. tip::
  
  When you join channels, depending on the `channel actions configured </channels/create-channels.html>`__, you may see a welcome message, and channels may be added to `a category in your channel sidebar </channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ automatically. 
  Access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.

Leave a channel
---------------

Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Leave Channel**. 

.. image:: ../images/leave-channels.png
  :alt: You can use channel options available from the channel name to leave a channel.

When you leave a private channel, you must be re-added by another channel member to rejoin. You won't receive mention notifications from a channel if you're not a member of that channel.
