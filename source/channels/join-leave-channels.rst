Join a channel
--------------

To join a public channel, select the **+** symbol at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**. Search through the list of public channels you can join, then select **Join**.

To join a private channel, you need to be added to the channel by a member of that channel.

.. tip::
  
  When you join new channels, depending on the `channel actions configured <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/create-channels.html>`__, you may see a message welcoming you, and channels may be added to `a category in your channel sidebar <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ automatically. 
  Access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.

Leave a channel
---------------

Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Leave Channel**. 

Any team member who leaves a private channel must be re-added by another channel member if they wish to rejoin. Team members will not receive mention notifications from channels of which they are not members.
