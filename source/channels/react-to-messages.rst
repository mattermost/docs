    **To react messages with emoji ** 
        
    React to messages with emoji by selecting the **Smile** |smile-icon| icon inside the Mattermost message input box to open the Emoji Picker. If the existing emojis available in Mattermost don't cover what you want to express, you can also `upload your own custom emoji <#upload-custom-emojis>`__.

    .. tip::
     
       You can also react to messages by typing ``:`` followed by at least two characters of the word describing the emoji, which will open an emoji autocomplete. Descriptions include skin tone details for people-based emojis, where supported.

    **Select recent emojis**

      From Mattermost v6.1 and in Mattermost Cloud, react to messages quickly by selecting a recent emoji while hovering over a message. Recent emojis are sorted based on the number of times you've used the emoji. If your most recent reactions aren't visible, you can enable quick reactions by selecting **Settings > Display > Quick reactions on messages**.

    **Select default skin tone**

     Select the **Skin Tone** icon in the top right corner of the Emoji Picker to specify the skin tone you prefer to use for people-based emojis by default. You can select an alternate skin tone any time.

    **Upload custom emojis**

     Everyone in your Mattermost workspace can use the custom emojis you upload. From the Emoji Picker, select **Custom Emoji**. Small, square pictures work best when selecting an image to upload. The file can be any JPG, GIF, or PNG that's up to one MB in size.

     1. Enter a name for your custom emoji. This is the name that shows up in the emoji autocomplete.
     2. Choose **Select**, then select the image to use for the emoji. 
     3. Select **Save**. Once saved, your emoji is added to the list of custom emoji.
