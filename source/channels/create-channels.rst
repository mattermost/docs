Create channels
===============

  :start-after: :nosearch:

Anyone can create public channels, private channels, direct messages, and group messages unless the System Admin has `restricted permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__.

.. tip::

  **Automate with channel actions**
  
  The user who creates a channel automatically becomes the Channel Admin. Channel Admins can access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to configure automatic actions when users `join the channel </channels/join-leave-channels.html#join-a-channel>`__ or `post a message </channels/send-messages.html>`__ to the channel.
  
  Automatic actions include:
  
  - Displaying a temporary welcome message for new channel members.
  - Automatically adding the channel to a `category in the user's channel sidebar </channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__.
  - Prompting to run a playbook based on the contents of a message.
