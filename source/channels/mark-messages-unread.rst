If you read a message but don't have time to address it right away, you can mark that message as unread. Marking a message as unread bolds the channel in your sidebar, and adds the new messages line above the marked message. 

To mark a message as unread, select the **More Actions** |more-actions-icon| icon visible when you hover over a message, then select **Mark as Unread**.
