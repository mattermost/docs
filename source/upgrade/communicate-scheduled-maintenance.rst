Communicate scheduled maintenance
==================================

Performing scheduled maintenance on a Mattermost server with 1,000 or more users requires advanced planning and a clear communication strategy to ensure minimal disruption and maximum transparency. 

This guide provides best practices for notifying users via email and Mattermost channels, updating the load balancerâ€™s error message, and configuring a dismissable banner to inform users of the upcoming maintenance.

Communication strategy
----------------------

A well-defined communication strategy is essential for informing users before, during, and after maintenance. The key components of this strategy are:

- Define a clear maintenance window in which the self-hosted Mattermost server will be unavailable.

    - Mattermost Cloud deployments have predefined service windows scheduled from 8:00-10:00 UTC on Saturdays only (when applicable) unless an exception has been made and communicated to impacted customers.
- `Email notifications <#email-templates>`__: Send structured and consistent emails to users at intervals of 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before the scheduled maintenance window.
- `Channel-based reminders <#channel-reminder-templates>`__: :doc:`Send messages </collaborate/send-messages>` similar to the emails in relevant Mattermost channels at the same intervals as the email notifications.
- `Mattermost Banner notification <#banner-notification>`__: Set a :doc:`system-wide notification </manage/system-wide-notifications>` to display at the top of the Mattermost instance ahead of the maintenance window and outage.
- `Display a load balancer message <#display-load-balancer-message>`__: Update the load balancer to show a maintenance message during the scheduled maintenance window of downtime.

Banner notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample message:

.. code-block:: text

    Heads up! Scheduled maintenance is planned for [Date],
    between [Start Time] and [End Time] [Time Zone]. 
    The Mattermost instance will be unavailable during this time.

Users can dismiss the banner until they log in again, or until you update the banner.

Display load balancer message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the load balancer to display a notification message during the scheduled maintenance window of downtime.

1. Identify the load balancer you are using (e.g., AWS, HAProxy).
2. Edit configuration. Adjust paths and configurations according to your specific environment.

  - For AWS, navigate to the Load Balancer configurations in the EC2 console.
  - For HAProxy, edit the ``haproxy.cfg`` file.

.. important::

    We strongly recommend adding headers, where needed in your infrastructure, to avoid outdated information being communicated to your users during and following server maintenance.

See the sample message HTML below to use as a starting point:

.. code-block:: html
