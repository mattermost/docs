Important Upgrade Notes
=======================

.. important::
   - Support for Mattermost Server v5.31 `Extended Support Release <https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/extended-support-release.html>`_ has come to the end of its life cycle as of October 15, 2021. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v5.37 `Extended Support Release <https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/extended-support-release.html>`_ or later is required.
   - The "version" CLI command will be deprecated in Mattermost v6.1.
   - Upgrading Mattermost can result in an error “ERROR: default for column "column_name" cannot be cast automatically to type jsonb” if you have non-JSON data in a column. This can also happen if the database data has been manipulated by external processes (e.g. plugins) and in cases where improper input data could get silently truncated due to varchar limits. The data in the affected database column has to be manually fixed.

|                                                    | The field type of Data in ``model.ClusterMessage`` was changed to []byte from string. Therefore, a major thing to note is that a v6 server is incompatible to    |
|                                                    | run along with a v5 server in a cluster. Customers upgrading from 5.x to 6.x cannot do a High Availability upgrade. While upgrading, it is required that no      | 
|                                                    | other v5 server runs when a v6 server is brought up. A v6 server will run significant database schema changes that can cause a large startup time depending on   |
|                                                    | the dataset size. Zero downtime will not be possible, but depending on the efforts made during the migration process, it can be minimized to a large extent.     |
|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                    | 1. Low effort, long downtime - This is the usual process of starting a v6 server normally. This has 2 implications: during the migration process, various        |
|                                                    | tables will be locked which will render those tables read-only during that period. Secondly, once the server finishes migration and starts the application, no   |
|                                                    | other v5 server can run in the cluster.                                                                                                                          |
|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                    | 2. Medium effort, medium downtime - This process will require SQL queries to be executed manually on the server. To avoid causing a table lock, a customer can   |
|                                                    | choose to use the pt-online-schema-change tool for MySQL. For Postgres, the table locking is very minimal. The advantage is that since there are a lot of        |
|                                                    | queries, the customer can take their own time to run individual queries during off-hours. All queries except #11 are safe to be executed this way. Then the      |
|                                                    | usual method of (1) can be followed.                                                                                                                             |
|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                    | 3. High effort, low downtime - This process requires everything of (2), plus it tries to minimize the impact of query #11. We can do this by following step 2,   |
|                                                    | and then starting v6 along with a running v5 server, and then monitor the application logs. As soon as the v6 application starts up, we need to bring down a v5  |
|                                                    | node. This minimizes the downtime to only a few seconds.                                                                                                         |
|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                    | It is recommended to start Mattermost directly and not through systemctl to avoid the server process getting killed during the migration. This can happen since  |
|                                                    | the value of ``TimeoutStartSec`` in the provided systemctl service file is set to 1 hour.                                                                        |
