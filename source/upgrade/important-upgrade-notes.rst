   - Support for Mattermost Server v7.1 :doc:`Extended Support Release </upgrade/extended-support-release>` has come to the end of its life cycle in May 15, 2023. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v7.8 :doc:`Extended Support Release </upgrade/extended-support-release>` or later is required.
   - MySQL 8.0.22 contains an `issue with JSON column types <https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=101284>`__ changing string values to integers which is preventing Mattermost from working properly. Users are advised to avoid this database version.
   - Upgrading the Microsoft Teams Calling plugin to v2.0.0 requires users to reconnect their accounts.
   - When upgrading to 7.x from a 5.x release please make sure to upgrade to 5.37.10 first for the upgrade to complete successfully.
   - Disable global drafts. Admins can set the feature flag ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_GLOBALDRAFTS`` to ``false`` to disable server-wide. It can't be disabled on a per-user basis. The code is located `here <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/server/public/model/feature_flags.go#L74>`__.

|                                                    | In the main `server package`, the Go module path has changed from ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/v8`` to                                       | 
|                                                    | ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8``. But with the introduction of the `public` submodule, it should no longer be necessary for third-party code to    |
|                                                    | import this `server` package.                                                                                                                                    |

|                                                    | Introduced the `public <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/public>`_ submodule, housing the familiar `model` and `plugin` packages,     |
|                                                    | but now discretely versioned from the server. It is no longer necessary to `go get` a particular commit hash, as Go programs and plugins can now opt-in to       |
|                                                    | importing `github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/public` and managing versions idiomatically. While this submodule has not yet shipped a v1 and will    |
|                                                    | introduce breaking changes before stabilizing the API, it remains both forwards and backwards compatible with the Mattermost server itself.                      | 
|                                                    +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                    | As part of the `public` submodule above, a ``context.Context`` is now passed to ``model.Client4`` methods.                                                       |

|                                                    | Removed support for PostgreSQL v10. The new minimum PostgreSQL version is now v11.                                                                               |

|                                                    | The Mattermost public API for Go is now available as a distinctly versioned package. Instead of pinning a particular commit hash, use idiomatic Go to add this   |
|                                                    | package as a dependency: go get github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/public. This relocated Go API maintains backwards compatibility with Mattermost   |
|                                                    | v7. Furthermore, the existing Go API previously at github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/v6/model remains forward compatible with Mattermost v8, but may not   |
|                                                    | contain newer features. Plugins do not need to be recompiled, but developers may opt in to using the new package to simplify their build process. The new public |
|                                                    | package is shipping alongside Mattermost v8 as version 0.5.0 to allow for some additional code refactoring before releasing as v1 later this year.               |

|                                                    | Three configuration fields have been added, ``LogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, ``ExperimentalAuditSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, and                          |
|                                                    | ``NotificationLogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON`` which support multi-line JSON, escaped JSON as a string, or a filename that points to a file containing JSON.    |
|                                                    | The ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` fields have been deprecated.                                                                                                       |

|                                                    | The Go MySQL driver has changed the ``maxAllowedPacket`` size from 4MiB to 64MiB. This is to make it consistent with the change in the server side default value |
|                                                    | from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. If your ``max_allowed_packet`` setting is not 64MiB, then please update the MySQL config DSN with an additional param of            |
|                                                    | ``maxAllowedPacket`` to match with the server side value. Alternatively, a value of 0 can be set to to automatically fetch the server side value, on every new   |

|                                                    | Removed ``ExperimentalSettings.PatchPluginsReactDOM``. If this setting was previously enabled, confirm that:                                                     |

|                                                    | 1. All Mattermost-supported plugins are updated to the latest versions.                                                                                          |
|                                                    | 2. Any other plugins have been updated to support React 17. See the section for v7.7 release for more information.                                               |

|                                                    | Removed deprecated ``PermissionUseSlashCommands``.                                                                                                               |

|                                                    | 2. Medium effort, medium downtime - This process will require SQL queries to be executed manually on the server. To avoid causing a table lock, a customer can   |
|                                                    | choose to use the pt-online-schema-change tool for MySQL. For Postgres, the table locking is very minimal. The advantage is that since there are a lot of        |
|                                                    | queries, the customer can take their own time to run individual queries during off-hours. All queries except #11 are safe to be executed this way. Then the      |
