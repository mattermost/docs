   - Support for Mattermost Server v7.8 :doc:`Extended Support Release </upgrade/extended-support-release>` is coming to the end of its life cycle in November 15, 2023. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v8.1 :doc:`Extended Support Release </upgrade/extended-support-release>` or later is recommended.
   - MySQL 8.0.22 contains an `issue with JSON column types <https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=101284>`__ changing string values to integers which is preventing Mattermost from working properly. Users are advised to avoid this database version.
   - Upgrading the Microsoft Teams Calling plugin to v2.0.0 requires users to reconnect their accounts.
   - When upgrading to 7.x from a 5.x release please make sure to upgrade to 5.37.10 first for the upgrade to complete successfully.
   - Disable global drafts. Admins can set the feature flag ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_GLOBALDRAFTS`` to ``false`` to disable server-wide. It can't be disabled on a per-user basis. The code is located `here <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/server/public/model/feature_flags.go#L74>`__.
   - Please see the `list of deprecations <https://docs.mattermost.com/install/deprecated-features.html>`_ planned for an upcoming v9.0 release (currently scheduled for September 15th, 2023).

|                                                    | the dataset size. Zero downtime will not be possible, but depending on the efforts made during the migration process, it can be minimized to a large extent.     |

|                                                    | 1. Low effort, long downtime - This is the usual process of starting a v6 server normally. This has two implications: during the migration process, various      |
|                                                    | tables will be locked which will render those tables read-only during that period. Secondly, once the server finishes migration and starts the application, no   |
|                                                    | other v5 server can run in the cluster.                                                                                                                          |

|                                                    | 2. Medium effort, medium downtime - This process will require SQL queries to be executed manually on the server. To avoid causing a table lock, a customer can   |
|                                                    | choose to use the pt-online-schema-change tool for MySQL. For Postgres, the table locking is very minimal. The advantage is that since there are a lot of        |
|                                                    | queries, the customer can take their own time to run individual queries during off-hours. All queries except #11 are safe to be executed this way. Then the      |
|                                                    | usual method of (1) can be followed.                                                                                                                             |

|                                                    | 3. High effort, low downtime - This process requires everything of (2), plus it tries to minimize the impact of query #11. We can do this by following step 2,   |
|                                                    | and then starting v6 along with a running v5 server, and then monitor the application logs. As soon as the v6 application starts up, we need to bring down a v5  |
|                                                    | node. This minimizes the downtime to only a few seconds.                                                                                                         |
