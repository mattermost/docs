Real-Time DevSecOps Collaboration
=================================

Modern mission-driven software teams—ranging from critical infrastructure operators to government software factories—face the challenge of delivering and defending complex systems at speed. From CI/CD pipelines to incident response, secure collaboration is essential to ensure resilience, compliance, and operational success in environments where failure is not an option.

Traditional messaging platforms, designed for commercial office settings, often introduce friction, fragmentation, and risk into DevSecOps workflows. These multi-purpose tools are optimized for generic team chat or water-cooler conversation—not for secure, structured collaboration in high-stakes delivery environments. As a result, critical signals get lost in noisy channels, response times slow down, and sensitive workflows are exposed to tools that lack operational control.

Mattermost provides a secure, real-time ChatOps platform designed for DevSecOps collaboration in high-assurance environments. Whether supporting sovereign software supply chains, regulated platforms, or air-gapped operational environments, Mattermost unifies delivery, security, and platform teams into a single, extensible system built for mission velocity and compliance.

The following mission-ready DevSecOps capabilities are available:

Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD) Coordination
-------------------------------------------------------

Coordinating secure software delivery requires tight integration between code commits, testing pipelines, release workflows, and stakeholder approval.

**Benefits**

- **Automate pipeline visibility and alerting** by integrating with CI/CD tools like GitLab, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions using the :doc:`Mattermost integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`.
- **Coordinate secure releases and hotfixes** using :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` to manage rollout steps, validation gates, and team notifications.
- **Enable traceable delivery communications** through :doc:`channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`, ensuring build logs, changelogs, and approvals remain accessible and audit-ready.
- **Support deployments in regulated and sovereign environments** using :doc:`self-hosted Kubernetes deployment models </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>` for full control over CI/CD communications.

Platform Engineering & Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Platform teams need streamlined, secure ways to deliver services and enable developers while maintaining governance and uptime.

**Benefits**

- **Centralize platform requests and updates** in :doc:`dedicated channels </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>` that organize provisioning, support, and environment status discussions.
- **Automate ticket triage and escalation workflows** using :doc:`Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` to track response SLAs and ownership across platform operations.
- **Monitor infrastructure health and changes** with integrated feeds from :doc:`Prometheus, Grafana </administration-guide/scale/deploy-prometheus-grafana-for-performance-monitoring>`, or custom observability tools—supporting faster feedback loops.
- **Support hybrid cloud and edge operations** through :ref:`deployment flexibility <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` across public, private, and disconnected environments.

Secure Incident Response for Production Systems
-----------------------------------------------

Real-time visibility and structured collaboration are critical during service degradations, outages, or suspected intrusions.

**Benefits**

- **Automate incident handling** with :doc:`Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` to track diagnostics, assign tasks, and issue updates—supporting NOC, SRE, and AppSec workflows.
- **Accelerate containment and recovery** by :ref:`integrating alerting tools <integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index:webhooks>` like PagerDuty, Opsgenie, and custom webhooks into secure Mattermost channels.
- **Ensure communication continuity** during outages using :doc:`high availability architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>` and :doc:`support for disconnected environments </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>`.
- **Enable forensic review and audit** with :ref:`logging and export capabilities <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>` that preserve all incident-related communications.

Policy-Driven Collaboration in Regulated Environments
------------------------------------------------------

Critical infrastructure DevSecOps must align with strict security, audit, and compliance requirements—including supply chain controls and Zero Trust architecture.

**Benefits**

- **Apply granular role-based access controls** using :doc:`advanced permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`channel-specific configurations <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` to protect sensitive workflows.
- **Support supply chain security coordination** by using :doc:`Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` to manage SBOM reviews, vendor risk analysis, and software intake workflows across internal and external teams.
- **Enforce secure collaboration behavior** through :doc:`custom Terms of Service </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`, :doc:`data retention policies </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`, and user authentication tied to :doc:`SSO and Entra ID </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`.
- **Deploy in line** with :doc:`Zero Trust </security-guide/zero-trust>` principles with :ref:`self-managed, segmented deployments <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` that enforce identity, access, and policy boundaries—suitable for classified or sovereign cloud environments.
