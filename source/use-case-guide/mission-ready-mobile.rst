Mission-Ready Mobile
====================

Mission environments demand secure, reliable mobile collaboration, from intelligence briefings and operational coordination to incident response in disconnected regions. Traditional mobile communication tools fail to meet the demands of field-forward operations, exposing sensitive data to third-party systems, and increasing the risk of data leakage, non-compliance, and operational compromise.

Mattermost provides a secure, mission-ready mobile platform built for defense, law enforcement, and public sector operations. Optimized for low-bandwidth and disconnected conditions, Mattermost ensures secure communication on government-issued devices while enabling compliant collaboration on personal phones—without reliance on consumer apps or invasive controls.

With protections including ID-only push notifications, biometric authentication, jailbreak detection, and full MDM/EMM support, Mattermost delivers control, compliance, and usability across a range of challenging field conditions.

The Mattermost server displays a list of security features, including "Zero Trust Security (Channel ABAC, Files ABAC)," "Secure File Viewer," "TLS Data in Transit (Post Quantum)," "Authentication and Access Control (MFA, SSO)," "Data Spillage Handling," and more, with asterisks (*) indicating functionality scheduled for release later in 2025. On the right, the mobile device mirrors corresponding security features, such as "Secure File Viewer," "TLS," "Burn on Read," "End-to-End Encryption," "Biometric Authentication," and others, with blue arrows connecting the related features on the server and the mobile device, signifying seamless integration and support for advanced security across these endpoints.

The following mobile-first operational capabilities are available.

Secure Mobile Access on Government Devices
-------------------------------------------

Mission teams require trusted mobile access to secure collaboration, ensuring operational integrity during deployments, transit, and high-tempo operations. Government-issued or EMM-enrolled devices offer a fully controlled, secure mobile environment.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy securely with enterprise mobility management (EMM)** using :ref:`AppConfig integrations <deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider:manage app configuration using appconfig>` to manage application policies, access controls, and encrypted communication channels.
- **Maintain control over mission-critical data**: Enable safe delivery of notifications via :ref:`ID-only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>` that prevent exposure of sensitive content to third-party systems like Apple or Google.
- **Mitigate data compromise risk in personnel transitions**: Protect data with :doc:`remote wipe and deactivation </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>` capabilities in the event of device loss, theft, or personnel separation.
- **Enforce strong identity assurance** through :ref:`native biometric authentication <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>` and :doc:`multi-factor authentication (MFA) </administration-guide/onboard/multi-factor-authentication>` tied to :doc:`SSO </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>` or :doc:`AD/LDAP </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>` provisioning .
- **Comply with classified mobility mandates** by using :ref:`secure data storage <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:mobile data isolation>`, :ref:`sandboxing <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:security measures>`, and FIPS 140-3-validated TLS in transit* to meet defense-grade standards.

Secure Government Communications on Personal Devices
-----------------------------------------------------

When personal devices are the only available channel—whether in partner nations, rural patrol units, or disconnected deployments—Mattermost provides a secure alternative to consumer messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp, enabling policy-compliant collaboration without compromising field effectiveness.

**Benefits**

- **Enable trusted communications on BYOD** using lightweight AppConfig policies with :doc:`EMM optionality </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>` that avoids intrusive control while ensuring essential security baselines.
- **Prevent unauthorized data sharing**: Mitigate leakage with :ref:`screenshot and screen recording prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>` and :ref:`jailbreak/root detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>` that block high-risk mobile behaviors.
- **Secure access without cloud dependency** via :ref:`self-hosted deployments <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` or :doc:`air-gapped infrastructures </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>` that prevent sensitive data from touching public networks.
- **Deliver rapid alerts with low bandwidth impact** using :ref:`ID-only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>`, ideal for DDIL (disconnected, intermittent, low-bandwidth) conditions.
- **Support interagency or coalition workflows** in mission-partner environments through :doc:`Connected Workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>` with :doc:`role-based </administration-guide/onboard/delegated-granular-administration>` and :doc:`attribute-based access controls (ABAC) </administration-guide/manage/admin/attribute-based-access-control>`.

Built for Field-Forward Security
---------------------------------

Mattermost on mobile is hardened to operate under mission-grade security expectations, whether it's used by intelligence teams in transit, patrol officers in the field, or coalition operators in disconnected regions.

**Features**

- **Zero Trust security architecture** with channel- and file-level :doc:`attribute-based access control (ABAC) </administration-guide/manage/admin/attribute-based-access-control>`.
- **TLS with post-quantum readiness** and end-to-end* :doc:`encryption options </security-guide/security-guide-index>` for high-assurance deployments.
- **Burn-on-read messaging**: Use :ref:`secure file viewers <security-guide/mobile-security:secure file preview>`, :ref:`burn on read messaging <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:send burn-on-read messages>`, and advanced data spillage controls* to protect sensitive information and minimize persistent data exposure.
- **DoD STIG container support** with FIPS 140-3 validation*, and :ref:`audit logging <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>` to ensure deployment compliance in regulated missions.
- **Isolated mobile sessions** from host operating systems by partnering with platforms like Hypori in high-assurance BYOD scenarios.

Features marked with an asterisk above ``*`` will be available in a future 2025 release.
