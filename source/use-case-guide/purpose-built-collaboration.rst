Purpose-Built Collaboration
===========================

From large-scale logistics operations to critical infrastructure defense, organizations are under pressure to act faster, with fewer resources and greater operational complexity. But legacy chat platforms and multi-purpose messaging tools can't keep pace with dynamic, high-stakes workflows. They lack the integration depth, security controls, and mission-specific configurability needed for real-time operational success.

Mattermost provides a purpose-built collaboration platform designed for technical, operational, and industrial teams. It brings people, tools, and workflows together in a secure, extensible environment—streamlining coordination, improving decision velocity, and increasing resilience. Whether coordinating a global logistics chain, managing operational technology (OT) in the field, or running a security operations center, Mattermost adapts to your environment—not the other way around.

The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

Global Logistics Coordination
-----------------------------

Coordinating logistics across continents, agencies, and time zones requires a secure, unified platform that centralizes communications and aligns stakeholders.

**Benefits**

- **Enable real-time coordination** across supply chains, procurement, and field units with :doc:`channel-based messaging </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>` and :doc:`playbook-driven workflows </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` that standardize communication and reduce friction.
- **Connect systems across logistics networks** by integrating ERP, fleet tracking, maintenance management, and transportation tools via :doc:`webhooks, APIs, and plugins </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`.
- **Preserve operational continuity** during outages or disruptions using :ref:`self-hosted deployments <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` and :doc:`high availability architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>` that eliminate reliance on third-party cloud services.
- **Support multilingual coordination** with :ref:`localized UI options <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>` in 20+ languages to ensure inclusive collaboration across global teams.

Operational Technology and ICS Collaboration
--------------------------------------------

OT and field operations in energy, utilities, manufacturing, and transportation sectors demand secure, real-time communication across widely distributed assets and personnel. From remote substations and industrial facilities to on-site emergency repair teams, teams must coordinate without exposing sensitive control systems or violating compliance standards.

Mattermost enables secure collaboration across OT environments and field operations, even under disconnected, air-gapped, or constrained network conditions.

**Benefits**

- **Enable compliant, real-time OT communications** across operational zones and facilities using :ref:`secure, on-prem collaboration <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` that keeps data within your control perimeter.
- **Support field teams with hardened mobile access** using :doc:`EMM-based app provisioning </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>`, :ref:`biometric authentication <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>`, :ref:`jailbreak detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>`, and :ref:`ID-only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>`—ensuring that only authorized, uncompromised devices can access operational data.
- **Integrate with industrial monitoring systems** like SCADA, PI historians, and plant analytics using :doc:`alert-driven webhook and plugin integrations </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>` that push system events to relevant mobile or desktop channels.
- **Ensure system and network isolation** with :doc:`air-gapped deployment support </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>` that allows full collaboration within OT enclaves and disconnected environments.
- **Prevent mobile data leakage** via :ref:`remote wipe capabilities <security-guide/mobile-security:mobile device management (mdm)>` and :ref:`screenshot/screen recording prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>` for mobile devices used in the field.

Technical Operational Command Centers
-------------------------------------

Engineering, infrastructure, and security teams manage increasingly complex environments. Whether responding to incidents, deploying software, or monitoring infrastructure, they need customizable workspaces that reduce cognitive load and integrate the tools they trust.

**Benefits**

- **Accelerate decision-making and incident response** using :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` to automate workflows for triage, patching, code releases, and security alerts.
- **Customize your collaboration environment** with :doc:`theming </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-theme>`, :doc:`custom branding </administration-guide/configure/custom-branding-tools>`, and :doc:`channel templates </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>` to mirror internal teams and operational domains.
- **Extend platform capabilities** with :doc:`slash commands, bots, and custom plugins </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>` that connect Mattermost to CI/CD systems, alerting frameworks, ticketing platforms, and internal tools.
- **Increase usability and team cohesion** with :ref:`custom emojis <end-user-guide/collaborate/react-with-emojis-gifs:upload custom emojis>`, shared terminology, and :doc:`real-time messaging </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>` optimized for platform engineers, DevSecOps teams, and field service managers.
