Maximize Your Microsoft Investments
===================================

Unlock the full potential of your Microsoft Teams, M365, and Entra ID investment with Mattermost. Designed for operational teams that require advanced customization, secure workflows, and seamless deployment on segregated networks, Mattermost enhances your existing Microsoft solutions for critical mission success.  

Mattermost complements Microsoft solutions with tailored capabilities designed to meet the unique needs of high-security environments, inter-agency collaboration, and external workflows, enabling teams to maximize their Microsoft investment.

The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

Sovereign Communication in Microsoft Teams
-------------------------------------------

Agencies and critical infrastructure organizations must often comply with strict data sovereignty rules that restrict cloud usage for sensitive collaboration.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy Mattermost on-premise or in sovereign clouds**, fully integrated with Microsoft Teams and Outlook (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`) to maintain workflow continuity and secure data storage.
- **Store messages, recordings, and transcriptions in compliance-approved systems**, with :ref:`data-at-rest encryption <security-guide/security-guide-index:data-at-rest encryption>` ensuring no leakage of sensitive data to third-party platforms.
- **Enable secure Microsoft Teams interactions via embedded Mattermost collaboration**, supporting operations within familiar interfaces while enforcing regulatory compliance. See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Enforce agency-specific policies** with :doc:`legal hold </administration-guide/comply/legal-hold>`, :doc:`retention policies </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`, and :doc:`user access controls </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` that align with national or sectoral mandates.

On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement
-------------------------------------------

As Skype for Business reaches end-of-life, secure organizations require an alternative that preserves on-premises control, integrates into Microsoft workflows, and meets the security standards of air-gapped and classified environments. Cloud-first replacements like Microsoft Teams are not always viable due to network segmentation, compliance restrictions, or data sovereignty mandates.
