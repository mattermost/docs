Self-Sovereign Collaboration
============================

As data privacy laws tighten and geopolitical risk escalates, organizations must rethink how they control and protect communications. Cloud-centric collaboration platforms often introduce legal exposure, third-party monitoring, and cross-border compliance conflicts—putting operations and data at risk. Whether driven by internal policy, regulatory mandates, or national data sovereignty requirements, more organizations are moving toward self-sovereign collaboration models.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible collaboration platform that delivers full control over data, infrastructure, and compliance posture. Built on a self-hosted, open core foundation, Mattermost supports localized deployments across air-gapped, private cloud, and sovereign environments—ensuring organizations can future-proof operations, meet global compliance demands, and maintain continuous operational continuity without third-party dependencies.

The following mission-ready sovereign collaboration capabilities are available:

Localized Compliance and Data Control
-------------------------------------

Managing global operations means adhering to regional regulations—without compromising productivity or communication security.

**Benefits**

- **Meet global compliance mandates** like GDPR and data localization laws by deploying Mattermost in :doc:`public, private, or sovereign cloud environments </product-overview/cloud-subscriptions>` tailored to national regulatory frameworks.
- **Ensure full data control and transparency** with :ref:`self-hosted deployment options <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` that eliminate exposure to vendor-controlled infrastructure or telemetry.
- **Audit and enforce compliance behavior** with :ref:`role-based access controls <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`, :doc:`custom Terms of Service </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`, and :ref:`audit logging <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>` to align with internal and regulatory standards.
- **Protect identity and access** using :doc:`SSO integrations </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`, :doc:`AD/LDAP synchronization </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap-groups-synchronization>`, and :doc:`MFA enforcement </administration-guide/onboard/multi-factor-authentication>` for secure authentication across geographies and operational roles.

Secure, Sovereign Deployment at Any Scale
-----------------------------------------

From national critical infrastructure to defense-grade networks, Mattermost offers flexible deployment models that preserve sovereignty and continuity.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy in classified, air-gapped, or disconnected environments** using :doc:`Kubernetes-based deployments </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>` and STIG-hardened container images to support classified operations and sensitive data workflows.
- **Eliminate third-party monitoring** with full control over infrastructure, encryption keys, access policies, and system-level logging.
- **Scale to meet operational growth** with :doc:`horizontal scalability architecture </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>` that supports tens of thousands of users in sovereign environments without degrading performance or control.
- **Maintain operational continuity under cyber or supply chain disruption** using fully self-managed infrastructure that ensures collaboration continues even during cloud outages or external service failures.

Interoperable Mission-Partner Collaboration
-------------------------------------------

Cross-agency, multinational, or coalition collaboration requires sovereignty without isolation—supporting joint operations while preserving organizational boundaries.

**Benefits**

- **Create secure shared workspaces** with :doc:`Connected Workspaces Channels </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>` that synchronize discussions, reactions, and file sharing across trusted organizations—without exposing internal systems.
- **Control access across organizations** with :doc:`attribute-based permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` and scoped identity policies to ensure mission alignment and sensitive information segmentation.
- **Deploy sovereign AI and workflow automation** in isolated environments using :doc:`air-gapped AI operations </end-user-guide/agents>` and :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`—enabling intelligence and speed without compromising data control.
- **Upgrade legacy platforms** like Skype for Business with modern, compliant tools for secure messaging, screen sharing, and team coordination. :doc:`See Skype for Business replacement options </use-case-guide/on-prem-skype-for-business-replacement>`.

Unified Collaboration for Secure Workflows
------------------------------------------

Legacy collaboration tools—such as Skype for Business and other end-of-life platforms—can no longer meet the demands of modern, high-assurance environments. These tools often lack support for mobile security, extensibility, and integration with mission-critical workflows, creating gaps in continuity, control, and user experience.

Mattermost replaces legacy, on-premises communication systems with a modern, sovereign collaboration platform built to support today's security, compliance, and operational agility requirements.

**Benefits**

- **Modernize secure messaging and team coordination** with :doc:`channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`, :doc:`threaded discussions </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`, and :doc:`file sharing </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>` that work across web, desktop, and mobile.
- **Replace outdated platforms** like Skype for Business with a scalable, :ref:`self-hosted architecture <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` that delivers enhanced user experience, compliance, and cross-organizational flexibility.
- **Protect sensitive information on mobile** using :doc:`enterprise-grade mobile security </security-guide/mobile-security>` including :ref:`biometric access <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>`, :ref:`jailbreak detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>`, :ref:`screenshot prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>`, and remote wipe—ensuring secure access from personal or field-issued devices.
- **Extend collaboration capabilities** using :doc:`integrated workflows and automations </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` to replace manual coordination with policy-driven processes.
- **Unify teams around a secure, customizable platform** that evolves with your mission and integrates with internal systems via :doc:`webhooks, plugins, and APIs </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`.
