Integrated Security Operations
==============================

**Fragmented security operations create the blind spots attackers exploit. Deploy unified collaboration that coordinates your entire security ecosystem in real-time.**

In today's evolving threat landscape, fragmented workflows, isolated teams, and disjointed tools create delays and blind spots in organizational defense. As threats scale across geopolitical, cyber, and supply chain domains, security operations must become more integrated,unifying monitoring, simulation, response, and intelligence into a continuous, coordinated system.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible platform for integrated security operations,built to support real-time coordination, mission-specific tooling, and sensitive communications. Whether deployed as a self-hosted Kubernetes instance, Linux server in your local data center, or in sovereign hosting environments, Mattermost empowers security teams to accelerate detection, decision-making, and coordinated response while maintaining full operational control. Built for security-conscious teams across commercial, government, and regulated industries, Mattermost supports integrated incident workflows and enterprise-level access control.

Mattermost supports security workflows across:

Security Operations Centers (SOCs)
----------------------------------

SOCs are the front lines of real-time monitoring, triage, and escalation. Coordinating across analysts, tools, and environments requires fast, structured communication and secure data handling.

**Benefits**

- **Accelerate triage and response workflows** with :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` that automate escalations, task assignment, and ticket updates for consistent response execution.
- **Integrate detection pipelines and observability tools** using the :doc:`Mattermost integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>` to surface alerts from SIEM, SOAR, and log analysis systems into dedicated response channels.
- **Maintain operational security and compliance** through :doc:`role-based permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`audit logging <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>` to safeguard sensitive incident data.
- **Operate in secure, classified, or hybrid environments** using Kubernetes or Linux on the infrastructure of your choice: Public cloud, organization data center, or fully air-gapped. :ref:`Explore deployment options <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`.
- **Meet regulatory compliance requirements** with a solution that adapts to your organization's security posture and regulatory requirements, incl. GDPR, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, and more.

Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs)
-----------------------------------------

CERTs serve as rapid-response teams during high-risk events, requiring tight coordination, reliable workflows, and cross-unit information flow.

**Benefits**

- **Orchestrate high-stakes incident response** through :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` tailored for malware outbreaks, data exfiltration events, and zero-day exploits.
- **Centralize and structure communication** with :doc:`channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`, including :doc:`file sharing </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`, :doc:`threaded updates </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`, and task-tracking across affected teams.
- **Enable coordination across geographies** using :doc:`multi-device access </deployment-guide/deployment-guide-index>` and :doc:`mobile EMM support </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>` for secure participation across locations and devices.
- **Preserve evidentiary and compliance data** through :ref:`audit logs <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>` and configurable :doc:`exports </administration-guide/manage/bulk-export-tool>` for legal review or forensic handoff.
- **Ensure data sovereignty** with flexible hosting options including EU-resident infrastructure, on-premises deployments, and air-gapped environments that maintain full control over sensitive communications.

Federated Threat Intelligence & Information Sharing
---------------------------------------------------

Cross-organizational threat intelligence teams,spanning sectors, regions, and public-private partnerships,require secure, policy-driven platforms for sharing indicators, coordinating alerts, and supporting collective defense efforts.

**Benefits**

- **Collaborate securely across agencies or organizations** using :doc:`Connected Workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>` to synchronize alerts, discussions, and file sharing with trusted external partners.
- **Support multinational and sectoral collaboration** with :doc:`custom terms of service enforcement </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>` and :ref:`localized UI settings <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>` for global partner access.
- **Preserve operational trust and compliance** through :doc:`role-based access controls </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`channel-specific permissions <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` that enforce jurisdictional and information-sharing agreements.
- **Operationalize shared threat intelligence** by integrating IOCs, threat actor profiles, and shared playbooks into your Mattermost instance via the :doc:`integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`.
- **Scale communication globally** with Mattermost's :doc:`high availability and horizontal scalability architecture </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>`,supporting tens of thousands of users across enterprise, field, government, or classified environments.
