Secure Command and Control
===========================

Expanding adversarial risk across cyber and kinetic domains requires faster, more secure, and better-informed coordination across mission environments. Traditional communication systems often fall short in high-stakes operational contexts—where minutes matter, information must remain contained, and decision advantage is critical to mission success. In an age of contested networks, personal device sprawl, and fragmented toolsets, organizations need a unified, secure platform to bridge communication and coordination gaps.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible Command & Control platform that accelerates decision advantage through real-time collaboration and mission-aligned workflows. It enables operational units, contractors, and mission partners to work together in tightly controlled environments—whether connected, disconnected, or degraded. With support for secure mobility, ChatOps, classified deployment models, and sovereign AI integrations, Mattermost empowers organizations to act faster, coordinate securely, and maintain operational resilience across the full mission lifecycle.

The following mission-ready coordination capabilities are available:

Mission-Critical ChatOps
------------------------

In high-stakes missions—including classified operations—real-time collaboration and secure workflows are essential for operational success. Mattermost unifies teams, toolchains, and decision-makers into a single secure environment.

**Benefits**

- **Surface essential context faster for decisive action** using :doc:`threaded messaging </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`, :doc:`file previews </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`, and :doc:`channel-based discussion </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>` to consolidate signals and reduce noise.
- **Integrate mission tooling and automation** via the :doc:`Mattermost integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`—connecting alerting, workflow engines, and tactical systems directly into operational channels.
- **Strengthen mobile communication channels** through :doc:`enterprise mobility security </security-guide/mobile-security>` that reduce reliance on personal messaging apps, control data exposure, and ensure secure, compliant access.
- **Coordinate operations with structured workflows** using :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` that standardize task execution, streamline decision-making, and maintain continuity across teams and mission roles.
- **Deploy sovereign AI for operational intelligence** using :doc:`air-gapped and private AI operations </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>` to power decision support and automation in disconnected or classified settings.

Disconnected, Intermittent, and Low-Bandwidth (DDIL) Collaboration
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Disconnected environments demand resilient tools that work without cloud access, persistent connectivity, or conventional device infrastructure.

    :alt: Mattermost's Self-Hosted Kubernetes-based Collaborative Workflow platform installs on edge, cloud and custom data center platforms.

**Benefits**

- **Operate in air-gapped and disconnected networks** using :doc:`self-hosted Kubernetes deployments </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>` and STIG-hardened container images for secure offline operations.
- **Ensure secure mobile access on managed or BYOD devices** with :doc:`mobile security features </deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features>`, Zero Trust enforcement, and :ref:`ID-only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>` for sensitive alerts.
- **Integrate with legacy and mission-specific systems** to maintain decision advantage in disconnected environments through :doc:`custom-built, self-hosted integrations </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>` tailored to your operational infrastructure.
- **Maintain command resilience** using :doc:`high availability cluster-based deployment </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>` and :doc:`horizontal scalability </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>` to support operational continuity at scale.
- **Automate field workflows** with :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>` that track tasks, manage field updates, and orchestrate responses under DDIL constraints.
- **Enable secure real-time collaboration with headquarters** using :doc:`Connected Workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>` to synchronize discussions, files, and reactions if connectivity is restored.

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) with Sensitive Information Protections
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern operations often require users—such as field personnel, mission partners, or remote contractors—to access critical communication tools from personal or unmanaged mobile devices. However, this flexibility introduces new risks when sensitive information or other protected data is involved. Without strong protections, mobile access becomes a liability in contested or regulated environments.

Mattermost provides enterprise-grade mobile protections to enable secure BYOD access without compromising security or compliance. From mobile application management and encryption enforcement to biometric authentication and jailbreak detection, Mattermost ensures that data remains protected, access is governed, and sensitive information stays within authorized boundaries.

**Benefits**

- **Mitigate unauthorized access** with :ref:`biometric authentication <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>` and :ref:`jailbreak/root detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>`, ensuring only secure and uncompromised devices can access mission data.
- **Control information sharing** with :ref:`screenshot and screen recording prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>`, blocking unauthorized capture of sensitive content during classified or time-sensitive discussions.
- **Protect data at rest and in motion** using encrypted mobile storage, :ref:`secure sandboxing <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:mobile data isolation>`, and :ref:`ID-only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>` that never expose message content to third-party cloud services.
- **Segment mission access by role or project** with :ref:`attribute-based access controls (ABAC) <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` and scoped channel access, ensuring users only see data aligned with their permissions and operational role.
- **Ensure continuous mobile compliance** with secure SDLC practices and proactive vulnerability management baked into the Mattermost mobile application lifecycle.


Mission-Partner Environments
----------------------------

Coordinating across departments, agencies, and external stakeholders—especially in multinational or coalition contexts—requires secure boundaries, role separation, and deployment flexibility.

**Benefits**

- **Unify mission stakeholders on a common-use platform** that supports :ref:`hybrid deployments <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` across private cloud, edge environments, and :doc:`air-gapped infrastructure </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>`.
- **Maintain data sovereignty and mission alignment** with deployments that avoid consumer infrastructure and retain control over all communications and file transfers—even in classified operations.
- **Apply role-based separation of access** through :doc:`advanced permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`channel-level controls <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` to protect mission integrity across organizational boundaries.
- **Enable secure real-time collaboration across entities** using :doc:`Connected Workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>` to synchronize discussions, files, and reactions between teams without compromising internal governance.
- **Reduce personal device risk** by offering secure enterprise communication options that eliminate the need for unauthorized messaging apps.
