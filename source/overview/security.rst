To expand on each: 

Security Features 
------------------------------------

Mattermost offers a host of features to help keep your private cloud communications secure. 

Private Cloud Deployment with Secure Mobile Apps 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Mattermost can run entirely behind your firewall as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL
   - Mattermost mobile apps can be deployed to an `internal Enterprise App Store <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/push.html#enterprise-app-store-eas>`_ by using source code available for Mattermost mobile apps and push notification service. Optionally `VPN clients on PC and mobile devices <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/deployment.html#vpn-setup>`_ can be used outside your private network.
   - Optionally, Mattermost mobile apps can run without a VPN by opening standard ports on your Mattermost server, such as 80 or 443. In this configuration, you have the option of using compiled `iOS and Android applications in iTunes and Google Play provided by Mattermost, Inc. <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/push.html#hosted-push-notifications-service-hpns>`_ (E10, E20), as well as enabling `multi-factor authentication <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-multi-factor-authentication-enterprise>`_ (E10, E20).
   - User sessions across web, PC and mobile can be `remotely revoked through account settings <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#view-and-logout-of-active-sessions>`_, or via the System Console by deactivating accounts. 

Centralized Security and Administration 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Manage users, teams, access control and system settings in a web-based `System Console user interface <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html>`_.

Transmission Security 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Mattermost supports TLS encryption using AES-256 with 2048-bit RSA on all data transmissions across both LAN and internet. 
   - Connections to Active Directory/LDAP can be optionally secured with TLS or stunnel (E10).
   - Encryption-at-rest is available through hardware and software disk encryption solutions applied to the Mattermost database, which can reside on its own server within your infrastructure.  
   - Option to `exclude message contents from push notifications <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#push-notification-contents>`_ to comply with strict compliance policies, such as US HIPAA standards.
   - Ability to exclude or include the `contents of messages in push notifications <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#push-notification-contents>`_ to avoid disclosure on locked mobile screens, and via relay servers from Apple and Google when sending notifications to iOS or Android mobile apps (relevant to compliance standards such as HIPAA) 
   
Integrity & Audit Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - By default, Mattermost stores a complete history of messages, including edits and deletes, along with all files uploaded. User interface actions for "deleting" messages, channels and private groups only remove the data from the user interface, the data is retained within your database. 
   - The `output and archives of server logs <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#file-log-directory>`_ can be saved to a directory of your choice. Mattermost server logs plus logs from your web proxy can provide an end-to-end history of system usage.
   - `Ad hoc compliance reports of messaging by user, date range, and keyword, including edited and deleted messages <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/compliance.html>`_ are available (E20). To protect against unauthorized use, all ad hoc report requests are logged. 
   - Daily compliance reports compatible with 3rd compliance solutions such as `Global Relay <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/compliance.html#global-relay-support>`_ are also available (E20). 

Authentication Safeguards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - To protect against brute force attacks, you can set `rate limiting on APIs <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#id55>`_, varied by query frequency, memory store size, remote address and headers.    
   - Session length and session cache can be `configured according to your internal policies <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#id33>`_.
   - Remotely `revoke user sessions <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#view-and-logout-of-active-sessions>`_ across web, mobile devices and native desktop apps.
   - Mattermost supports integrated authentication with `Active Directory and LDAP <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-ldap.html>`_ (E10) as well as `Active Directory Federation Services <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-adfs.html>`_ and `Okta <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-okta.html>`_ via SAML 2.0 (E20)
   - The ability to require `multi-factor authentication <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/auth.html>`_ is also available (E10) 

Access Control Policy 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Limit communications to specific users, private groups, or team-wide public channels
   - Increase system security `by restricting email-based account creation to email addresses from a list of specific domains, <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#restrict-account-creation-to-specified-email-domains>`_ e.g. "corp.mattermost.com", "mattermost.org", etc." 
   - Choose whether to restrict or enable `cross-origin requests. <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-cross-origin-requests-from>`_
   - If sharing of public links for account creation or sharing of files and images are enabled, links can be invalidated via the System Console by `regenerating salts <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#public-link-salt>`_. 
   - Optionally restrict `creation, renaming, archiving of channels, private groups and integrations to team admins, system admins or end users <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#policy-enterprise>`_ (E10)
   - Optionally restrict `sending team invites to team admins, system admins or end users <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#policy-enterprise>`_ (E10)
   - Optionally add `advanced passwords requirements <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#password-requirements-enterprise>`_ with minimum numbers of symbols, numbers, and lower and uppercase letters (E10).

HIPAA compliance 
------------------------------------

Deploying Mattermost as part of a HIPAA-compliant IT infrastructure requires a deployment team trained on `HIPAA-compliance requirements and standards <http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/>`_.

- Mattermost offers HIPAA-relevant **Technincal Safeguards** including: 

     - `Integrity Controls <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/security.html#integrity-audit-controls>`_
     - `Access Control <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/security.html#access-control-policy>`_
     - `Transmission Security <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/security.html#transmission-security>`_
     - `Audit Controls <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/security.html#integrity-audit-controls>`_
     
- HIPAA-compliant deployments commonly consider the following: 
     
     - Omitting the contents of messages from mobile push notifications:
     
        - If your `Push Notifications Contents <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#push-notification-contents>`_ option is set to ``Send full message snippet`` there is a chance Personal Health Information (PHI) contained in messages could be displayed on a user's locked phone as a notification. To avoid this, set the option to ``Send generic description with user and channel names``.

- Beyond Technical Safeguards, HIPAA compliance deployments also require: 

     - Administrative Safeguards
     - Physical Safeguards
     - Organizational requirements and other standards. 

To learn more, please review `HIPAA requirements from the US Department of Health and Human Services <http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/>`_.
