About the Mattermost Open Source Project
-----------------------------------------

At its core, Mattermost is an open source alternative to proprietary SaaS collaboration for teams. The software, developed in partnership with over 500 contributors from around the world, is designed to increase the agility, efficiency and innovation in high trust organizations while keeping data and operations under IT control.

Core committers, including both community contributors and paid staff at Mattermost, Inc., determine the project roadmap. For enterprises with needs beyond the scope of the open source project, commercial "Enterprise Edition" extensions are available from Mattermost, Inc. Partnership with our core committer community, along with revenue from Enterprise Edition, ensures the continued improvement of all editions.

Mattermost Team Edition
-----------------------

A free-to-use, open source, self-hosted alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging. Team Edition is your open source "virtual office", offering all the core productivity benefits of competing SaaS solutions. It deploys as single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL under an MIT license.

The open source Mattermost Team Edition is functionally identical to the commercial Mattermost editions in its free “team mode”, but there is no ability to unlock commercial features.

We generally recommend installing a commercial edition, even if you don't currently need a license. This provides the flexibility to seamlessly unlock commercial features should you need them. However, if you only want to install software with a fully open source code base, then Team Edition is the best choice for you.

Features include:

- One-to-one and group messaging, file sharing, and unlimited search history
- Native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux
- Threaded messaging, emoji, and custom emoji
- Tools for custom branding
- Continuous archiving
- Multi-factor authentication
- Highly customizable `third-party bots, integrations <https://about.mattermost.com/community-applications/#publicApps>`__, and `command line tools <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/command-line-tools.html>`__
- Extensive integration support via `webhooks, APIs, drivers <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/integration.html>`__, and `third-party extensions <https://about.mattermost.com/default-app-directory/>`__
- Easily scalable to dozens of users per team
- `Runtime profiling data and system monitoring reports <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/metrics.html#standard-go-metrics>`__
- New features and improvements released regularly
- Multiple languages including U.S. English, Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Turkish, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian

Mattermost Commercial Deployment Options
----------------------------------------

Mattermost provides additional benefits in our commercial editions to support the hosting and growth needs of an organization. You can explore these commercial features through a trial on Mattermost On-premise or Mattermost Cloud deployment options.  

Mattermost On-premise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mattermost On-premise provides Mattermost within IT-controlled private environments in public clouds, including AWS and Azure, as well as on-premise in private clouds and virtual or physical servers.

Once you’ve downloaded and installed Mattermost within your preferred environment you have the option to use it as-is, or you can access Mattermost's commercial features, by uploading a license. You can start a 30 day Enterprise trial via **Main Menu > System Console > Edition and License > Start trial** or request a trial at https://mattermost.com/trial/. 

Mattermost Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mattermost Cloud delivers Mattermost in a highly secure, hosted cloud environment designed for privacy-conscious enterprises and developer collaboration. 

To get started with a 14 day trial of Mattermost Cloud Professional, visit https://mattermost.com/mattermost-cloud.  Signing up requires creating an account with a business email and specifying a domain for the workspace. Once you sign up and create your workspace, a wizard will guide you through a quick setup, invitation for team members, and integration with developer tools. 

Mattermost Commercial Editions
-------------------------------
The on-premise and cloud editions of Mattermost have equivalent features, aside from a few cases where a feature is specific to the deployment model. For example Omnibus or Kubernetes deployment tools are only available for our on-premise offering as they are specific to self-hosting Mattermost. 

Our open-source, self-managed Team Edition will remain free forever with features that align with our Starter Edition on-premise.  We do not currently offer a free edition of Mattermost Cloud, however, provide it at a very low cost to make it a plausible option for teams with budgetary limitations.

Packaging Changes
------------------
As the platform matures, and new features are added, features will be evaluated and included in the edition that best matches the primary use case(s) for the feature as outlined above. Multiple factors are considered in determining which tier to include a feature including, security, compliance, scalability, mission-critical impact, and relative value to the enterprise.

We recognize there aren't any features that are only useful to managers, directors, and executives. Individual practitioners may want certain features; however, we think that other buyers are relatively more likely to care about it. We also recognize that there may be some features that are put into a tier to find later there is much demand for it by individuals or teams; we will not hesitate to move that feature to a lower tier.  We value feedback from our community and iterate based on feedback. Simultaneously, we also need to offer commercial products that hold value and do our best to find the right balance. We believe the more of Mattermost that you use, the more likely it is that you benefit from a higher tier.
