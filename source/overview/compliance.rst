Overview 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The U.S. government regulates the transfer of information, commodities, technology and software considered
to be strategically important to the U.S. in the interest of national security, economic and/or foreign policy
concerns. Many countries outside of the U.S. have similar controls on exports for the same reasons.

There is a complex network of U.S. agencies and inter-related regulations that govern exports collectively referred
to as “Export Controls". 

It is the policy of Mattermost to comply with all export compliance laws in all countries in which it transacts 
business. Because Mattermost is a U.S.-based global company, our products, collectively referred to as “Commodities”,
which include our software, as well as equipment, materials and services, are subject to the export laws and regulations
of every country in which we conduct business. Non-compliance with export control regulations can subject Mattermost
and its affiliates, including customers, employees and business partners to criminal and civil penalties, the seizure
of assets, the denial of export privileges, suspension or debarment from Government Contracts.

For these reasons, please take the time to familiarize yourself with applicable export (and import) controls in the
jurisdictions in which you operate. Although Mattermost cannot provide advice on export matters, you will find on 
this web page information you may need in order export Mattermost products.

This overview is specific to the `U.S. Export Administration Regulations <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear>`_ (EAR), however business operations may subject you to other regulations also, such as the `International Traffic in Arms Regulations <https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=24d528fddbfc930044f9ff621f961987>`_.

General Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start by taking a look at the `U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security <https://www.bis.doc.gov/>`_ website. Then go to `Part 730 <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/410-part-730-general-information/file>`_ of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations to understand what the regulations cover and review what is “Subject to
the EAR” under `734.2 <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/412-part-734-scope-of-the-export-administration-regulations/file>`_ (“export controlled”). 

Export Classification and Licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although what is subject to the Export Administration Regulations is quite broad, that does not mean an export license
is required for every transaction. The foundation of understanding export controls related to hardware, software and
technology is conducting the classification review - the `Commerce Control List <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/commerce-control-list-ccl>`_ (CCL) has 10 categories, 0-9, and is set up as a positive list. The first step is determining if the item to be exported is subject to the EAR.

At Mattermost, our Team Edition software is `outside the scope of the EAR <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption/1-encryption-items-not-subject-to-the-ear>`_, as it is derived from publicly available encryption source code and the complete software package for both the source code (https://github.com/mattermost/) and binary versions are publicly available. Mattermost enterprise software is found in `Category 5, Part 2 <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulations-docs/federal-register-notices/federal-register-2014/951-ccl5-pt2/file>`_ of the CCL, as Telecommunications and Information Security items (Hardware, software and technology). Most items in this category have encryption.

Often a license exception under `Part 740 <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/415-part-740-license-exceptions/file>`_ is available, where a Commerce Control List item lists the available license exception(s) specific to an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), based on a combination of factors. 

Mattermost Enterprise Edition software is found under `ECCN 5D002 <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulations-docs/federal-register-notices/federal-register-2014/951-ccl5-pt2/file>`_, with a License Exception available of `“ENC” <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/415-part-740-license-exceptions/file>`_, for our E10 and E20 software, with encryption features derived from open source software. Encryption products, under the export regulations, have multiple levels of controls and requirements. BIS has a separate section of their website that has an overview, and many links covering encryption, under `Policy Guidelines <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption>`_ that you may want to review. These guidelines include helpful flow charts for determining if an item is subject to encryption controls, tables and other details.

The other key areas to be aware of for export of Mattermost software or technology are:

**Sanctions**: There are comprehensive sanctions to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and other countries/territories
with specific prohibitions, such as Russia and Venezuela, that you’ve probably been hearing about in the news. Details
located here: `BIS <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/regulations-docs/federal-register-notices/federal-register-2014/1063-746-1/file>`_ and `OFAC <https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/default.aspx>`_. The countries and sanctions are subject to change.

**WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction)**: Mattermost, its customers, and business partners may not export to parties involved
in `proliferation <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/413-part-736-general-prohibitions/file>`_ of weapons of mass destruction, along with other prohibited end-uses under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”).

**General Prohibitions**: Information on General Prohibitions under the EAR are located `here <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/413-part-736-general-prohibitions>`_. Application of the applicability of these General Prohibitions is based on a combination of factors. Classification of the commodity, Destination, End-user, End-use and Conduct.

**Restricted Parties**: You may not export to parties listed on US government `restricted parties lists <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern>`_, and should be screening against these prior to export. There is a `consolidated screening list <http://apps.export.gov/csl-search#/csl-search>`_ available supported by the U.S. government at export.gov at no charge, to use for screening.

**Deemed Exports**:  Release of controlled technology to foreign persons in the U.S. is "deemed" to be an export to the
person’s country or countries of nationality and is found in `734.2(b) <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/412-part-734-scope-of-the-export-administration-regulations/file>`_ of the EAR, which you can read about under the Export Administration Regulations on the BIS website.

**Know your Customer**: You’ll see by reviewing the BIS website that it is very important to “know your customers”, be 
aware of `“Red Flags” <https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/compliance-a-training/export-management-a-compliance/freight-forwarder-guidance/23-compliance-a-training/51-red-flag-indicators>`_ and screen business partners and customers to ensure compliance.
