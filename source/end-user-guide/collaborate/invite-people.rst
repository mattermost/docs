.. note::

  - Can't share invitation links? Contact your Mattermost system admin for assistance. An :doc:`SSL certificate (or a self-signed certificate) </administration-guide/identity-access/ssl-client-certificate>` may be required for link-based invitations to work.
  - An invite link can be used by anyone and doesn’t change unless it’s re-generated by a system admin or team admin via **Team Settings > Access > Invite Code**.
  - Your system admin must :ref:`enable email invitations <administration-guide/configuration-reference/authentication-configuration-settings:enable email invitations>` and configure :ref:`email <administration-guide/getting-started/environment-configuration-settings:smtp>` for Mattermost to send email-based invitations.
    - Invitation links sent by email expire after 48 hours and can only be used once.
  - Your system admin can :ref:`cancel all email invitations <administration-guide/configuration-reference/authentication-configuration-settings:invalidate pending email invites>` that haven't yet been accepted within the System Console.
