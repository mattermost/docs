From Mattermost v10.9, users with admin permissions can enable channel banners to remind channel members about being diligent to avoid data spillage in channels that aren't intended for classified or sensitive information. These non-dismissible banners can be styled using Markdown and are visible across all Mattermost clients, including web browsers, the desktop app, and the mobile app.

Channel banner use cases include the following:

- Security classifications, such as **SENSITIVE INFORMATION: IMPACT LEVEL 5** with a distinctive color to alert members of the required security level.
- Important notices, such as **Reminder: Code complete deadlines are Fridays at 3 PM**, for recurring reminders.
- Policy or terms, such as  **All discussion in this channel is private and restricted** with a red color to signal caution.

Mattermost :ref:`channel admins <end-user-guide/collaborate/learn-about-roles:channel admin>`, :ref:`team admins <end-user-guide/collaborate/learn-about-roles:team admin>`, and :ref:`system admins <end-user-guide/collaborate/learn-about-roles:system admin>` can enable a banner with custom text at the top of Mattermost public or private channels. 

Create a channel banner:

1. Open a channel where you have administrative permissions.
2. Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Channel Settings**.
3. Select **Configuration** and enable the **Channel Banner** option.
4. Specify the banner text you want to display at the top of the channel. You can style the text using :ref:`Markdown <end-user-guide/collaborate/format-messages:use markdown>`, if desired.
5. Select the banner color.
6. Select **Save** to apply the changes. The banner displays immediately.

Change a channel banner
------------------------

You can change the banner text or color at any time by following the same steps above. The new banner text or color displays immediately.

Remove a channel banner
-------------------------

Disable the **Channel Banner** option in the channel settings to remove the banner from the channel.

  System admins can grant any user the ability to create and manage channel banners by assigning the **Manage Channel Banners** permission in the System Console. See the :doc:`advanced permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>` documentation for details.
