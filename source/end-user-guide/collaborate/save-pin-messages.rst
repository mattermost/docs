You have two ways to mark a post to make it easy to find later: 

- `Saving a message <#save-messages>`__ saves it for only you. 
- `Pinning a message <#pin-messages>`__ marks it for an entire channel.

Pin messages
------------

All members of a channel can pin important or useful messages to that channel. The list of pinned messages is visible to all channel members. There is no limit to the number of pinned posts in a channel. From Mattermost v10.2, the **Pinned** |pinned-messages| icon is hidden when no messages are pinned.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  1. Hover over the message that you want to pin. The **More** |more-icon| icon link appears.
  2. Select the **More** option, then select **Pin to channel**.

  Pinned messages are marked with the pinned icon. For example:
