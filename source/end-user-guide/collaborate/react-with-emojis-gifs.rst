Emojis and GIFs are small, digital images, animated images, or icons you can use to communicate or express concepts such as emotions, humor, and physical gestures in your messages.

From Mattermost v10.10, text emoticons (such as ``:)`` or ``:D``) are automatically converted to emoji characters in your messages by default. You can :ref:`disable this auto-rendering <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:render emoticons as emojis>` if you prefer to keep emoticons as text. 

Quick emoji reactions
-----------------------

You can react with up to 50 emojis per message. Recently used emojis are sorted based on how often you've used them. Don't see your most recently used emojis? Enable quick reactions by going to **Settings > Display** and enabling **Quick reactions on messages**.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Hover over a message to select a recently used emoji.

Manage emojis
-------------

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can select recently used emojis, select a default skin tone for people-based emojis, as well as manage custom emojis. From Mattermost mobile v2.37.0, you can select custom emojis and apply custom skin tones on mobile devices.

Select default skin tone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the **Skin tone** icon in the top right corner of the emoji picker to specify the skin tone you prefer to use for people-based emojis by default. You can select an alternate skin tone at any time.

Upload custom emojis
--------------------

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can upload new emojis that everyone in your Mattermost :doc:`workspace </end-user-guide/end-user-guide-index>` can access to react to messages, unless your system admin has :ref:`disabled your ability to do so <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable custom emoji>`.

1. From the emoji picker, select **Custom Emoji**.
