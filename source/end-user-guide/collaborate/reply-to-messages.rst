Depending on how your system admin has configured Mattermost, you may be able to :ref:`edit <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:edit messages>`, :ref:`restore <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:restore a previous version of an edited message>`, and :ref:`delete <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:delete messages>` messages after you've sent them.

.. tip::

  It's easy to return to a message in progress with global message drafts. Find all of your draft messages in the **Drafts** view available at the top of the channel sidebar. See the :ref:`draft messages <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:draft messages>` documentation for details.

Organize discussions into threads
-----------------------------------

When you reply to messages, those replies are :doc:`organized into a discussion thread </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`. Threaded discussions are easy to follow and allow multiple parallel conversations to occur at the same time without confusion. 

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, replies appear indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message. Selecting the reply link opens a sidebar in the right-hand sidebar in a web browser and the desktop app. To expand the right-hand sidebar to its full width, select the **Expand** icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar.

To shrink the right-hand sidebar to its original width, select the same **Collapse** icon.
