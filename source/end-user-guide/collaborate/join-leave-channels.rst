Join a channel
--------------

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a **Globe** |globe| icon. Anyone on the team can join a public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are identified with a **Lock** |lock| icon. You must be invited to private channels by another channel member.

.. note::
  
  To join a private channel, you need to be added to the channel by a member of that channel.

To join a public channel:

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  1. Select the **Add channels** button in the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**.

.. tip::

  When you join channels, depending on the :doc:`channel actions configured </end-user-guide/collaborate/create-channels>`, you may see a welcome message, and channels may be added to :doc:`a category in your channel sidebar </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar>` automatically. 
  Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.

See the following documentation to learn more about working with channels:

- :doc:`Create channels </end-user-guide/collaborate/create-channels>`
- :doc:`Browse channels </end-user-guide/collaborate/browse-channels>`
- :doc:`Customize your channel sidebar </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar>`

Leave a channel
---------------

When you leave a private channel, you must be re-added by another channel member to rejoin. You won't receive mention notifications from a channel if you're not a member of that channel.

.. note::

  All users are added to the **Town Square** channel automatically. This means that users can't :ref:`archive <end-user-guide/collaborate/archive-unarchive-channels:archive a channel>`, :ref:`unarchive <end-user-guide/collaborate/archive-unarchive-channels:unarchive a channel>`, or leave the **Town Square** channel. However, :doc:`guests </administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts>` who are manually invited to **Town Square** can leave the channel.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Leave Channel**.
