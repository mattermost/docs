Share links to channels and messages
====================================

.. include:: ../../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

You can share links to Mattermost `channels <#share-channel-links>`__ and `messages <#share-message-links>`__ with other Mattermost users. 

Share channel links
-------------------

Sharing channel links makes it easy for others to find and join channels. To share a link to a channel, type ``~`` into the message text box, then select the channel you want to link to. If you're a member of multiple teams, only channels for the current team are listed.

.. tip::

  Alternatively, you can select the **View info** |channel-info| icon in the top right corner of the screen to access additional channel management options, including a **Copy Link** option you can share with others.

Share message links
-------------------

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Sharing message links displays a preview of the message in the post. To share links to messages in Mattermost, select the **More** |more-icon| icon next to a message, then select **Copy Link**.

  Paste the link into a message to share the image link with others. Sharing links to messages generates a preview of the message.

  .. tip::

    - You can also hover over an image and select the |copy-link-icon| icon in the top right corner. 
    - The timestamp next to the username of any message is also a permanent link to that conversation.

.. tab:: Mobile

  Long press a message, and then tap **Copy Link** to copy the link to the clipboard. Long press to paste the link as a message or reply. From mobile v2.23, sharing links to messages generates a preview of the message.

.. note::

  - Message previews respect channel membership permissions, so theyâ€™re only visible to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a message in a public channel, any member of the team can see the message preview. If the link is to a message in a private channel or direct message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.
  - If you're unable to share links, contact your Mattermost system admin for assistance. An :doc:`SSL certificate (or a self-signed certificate) </administration-guide/onboard/ssl-client-certificate>` may be required for this functionality to work.

Deep links
-----------

Deep links are a powerful feature in Mattermost that allow you to create direct links to specific teams, channels, messages, or threads. These links can be used to quickly navigate to important content within Mattermost, enhancing collaboration and efficiency.

Deep links can also be used, in combination with bots, scripts, and integrations, to trigger specific actions within Mattermost.

From Mattermost v10.11, :doc:`channel bookmarks </end-user-guide/collaborate/manage-channel-bookmarks>` containing ``mattermost://`` open directly in the desktop app using deep linking. This turns channel bookmarks into one-click shortcuts that enable you jump straight to key assets in Mattermost quickly and easily.

Format deep links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deep links must be formatted in Mattermost as follows:

- Deep link to a team: ``mattermost://<your-Mattermost-server-URL>/<team-name>``
- Deep link to a channel: ``mattermost://<your-Mattermost-server-URL>/<team-name>/channels/<channel-name>``
- Deep link to a channel message or thread: ``mattermost://<your-Mattermost-server-URL>/<team-name>/pl/<post-id>``
- Deep link to a direct message: ``mattermost://<your-Mattermost-server-URL>/<team-name>/messages/@<user-name>``
