From Mattermost v7.10, using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can set 1 timed reminder on a post made in a channel, direct message, and group message. The ability to set up recurring reminders isn't supported.

Hover over the message you want to remember, select the **More** |more-icon| option, then select **Remind**. Select a time period or enter a custom date and time. You'll receive a direct message at the time you've chosen, with the body of the message you wanted to be reminded about.

Once you've been reminded about a message, you won't receive another reminder unless you set one.

.. tip::

  From Mattermost v10.3, you can also schedule reminder messages to be sent in the future. See the :doc:`schedule messages </end-user-guide/collaborate/schedule-messages>` documentation for details.
