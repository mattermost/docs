Install Boards
---------------

Your system admin may need to install and enable Mattermost Boards before you can use it. See the :doc:`install Mattermost Boards </administration-guide/configure/install-boards>` documentation to learn how to install and configure the Boards plugin for your Mattermost instance.

What's a board?
---------------

A board is a collection of cards to help you manage your projects, organize tasks, and collaborate with your team all in one place.

Boards can be displayed and filtered in different views such as kanban, table, calendar, and gallery views to help you visualize work items in the format that makes most sense to you. Learn about :doc:`working with boards </end-user-guide/project-management/work-with-boards>`.

What's a card?
--------------

Cards are used on a board to track individual work items. Cards are customizable and can have a number of properties added to them, which are then used as a way to tag, sort, and filter the cards.

When working with cards, you can manage properties, add descriptions, attach images, assign them to team members, mention team members, add comments, and so on. Learn more about :doc:`working with cards </end-user-guide/project-management/work-with-cards>`.
