End User Guide
================

If you're using Mattermost to connect and collaborate, build repeatable, automated processes, and making Mattermost match your work preferences, this Mattermost end user product documentation is for you.

In this documentation, you'll learn about using Mattermost. Your Mattermost system admin has deployed Mattermost for your organization. A live Mattermost instance is ready for you to log into using your user credentials. Your Mattermost workspace is where you'll send and receive messages, see activity notifications, create, run, and participate in playbook runs, and where you'll customize look and feel through workspace preferences.
