  General
  ~~~~~~~

  - **Download Location**: Specify where on your machine you want files to be downloaded from the desktop app.
  - **Show icon in the notification area**: The Mattermost icon displays in the notification area. You can hide this icon if preferred. Restart the desktop app to apply changes to this setting.
  - **Synchronize Desktop App theme with server**: The desktop app theme automatically matches the theme set on your primary Mattermost server. Disable this setting to manage desktop app themes independently.
  - **Open app in full screen**: Configure the desktop app to open in fullscreen. Disable this setting to open the app in a windowed view.
  - **Maximum number of open views**: From Desktop v6.0, set the maximum number of open tabs and windows per workspace. When a limit is set, Mattermost prompts you to close tabs or windows when the limit is exceeded. Leave this field blank for no maximum limit.

  Notifications
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - **Show red badge on Dock icon to indicate unread messages**: A red badge on the Dock icon displays a count of unread messages and mentions. You can configure the desktop app to display a count of mentions only, if preferred.
  - **Bounce the Dock icon**: When a new message is received on any of your active teams and servers, the Dock icon bounces once or bounces until you open the desktop app. You can configure the Mattermost Desktop App Dock icon to bounce more, less, or not at all.

  Language
  ~~~~~~~~

  - **App Language**: Specify your preferred language for the desktop app.
  - **Check spelling**: Misspelled words detected in your messages are highlighted based on your app language preference. You can disable spell check if preferred.

  - **Spell Checker Languages**: Specify additional spell check languages if needed. Restart the desktop app to change this setting. When multiple languages are configured:

    - All selected languages show as spelled correctly when a word matches at least one selected language
    - All selected languages show as spelled incorrectly when a word matches none of the selected languages.

  - **Use an alternative dictionary URL**: Specify an alternate dictionary for spell check as a site URL.

  - **Logging level**: Adjust logging levels to isolate and troubleshoot issues. Increasing the log level increases disk space usage and can impact performance.
  - **Send anonymous usage data to your configured servers**: Send desktop app usage and performance data to your configured Mattermost servers set up to accept it.
  - **Use GPU hardware acceleration**: GPU hardware acceleration renders the desktop app interface more efficiently. If you encounter decreased stability, disable GPU hardware acceleration. Restart the desktop app to apply changes to this setting.
