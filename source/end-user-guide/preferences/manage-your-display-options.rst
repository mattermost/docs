        **Compact** mode fits more messages on the screen by decreasing the spacing around posts, collapsing link previews, and hiding thumbnails so that only file names are shown. Some formatting types, such as block quotes and headings, are also reduced in size.

        When you select **Compact**, usernames are colorized by default, and username colors are consistent for all users. Disable the **Colorize usernames** option to display all usernames in a single color instead.
