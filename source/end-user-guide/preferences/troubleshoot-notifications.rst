Troubleshoot notifications
==========================

.. include:: ../../_static/badges/all-commercial.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

The Mattermost notifications you receive depend on your `Mattermost preferences <#check-your-mattermost-preferences>`__, the `Mattermost client <#check-your-mattermost-client-settings>`__ you're using, and the `operating system (OS) <#check-your-operating-system-settings>`__ you're running Mattermost on.

Send yourself a test notification
----------------------------------

From Mattermost v10.3, you can send yourself a test notification by selecting **Settings** |gear|, and going to the **Notifications** options.

Under **Troubleshooting notifications** select the **Send a test notification** option. If notifications are working, you'll receive a system-bot direct message in Mattermost confirming that notifications are working. 

If you don't receive a system-bot direct message, see the following sections for troubleshooting steps you can follow to ensure you're receiving the notifications you want.

Check your Mattermost preferences
----------------------------------

Start by ensuring that your Mattermost preferences have notifications enabled.

.. tab:: Desktop

  1. Select **Settings** |gear| in the top right corner of Mattermost.
  2. Select **Desktop and mobile notifications**.

  If **Send notifications for** is set to **Nothing**, then Mattermost notifications are currently disabled. Select either the **All new messages** or **Mentions, direct messages, and group messages** option instead, and save your changes.

Are mobile push notifications free?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, push notifications are free if you compile your own `push-proxy service <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-push-proxy>`__. Push notifications are also free if you use the hosted Test Push Notification Service (TPNS) provided by Mattermost, Inc.

TPNS, hosted at `https://push-test.mattermost.com <https://push-test.mattermost.com>`_, offers transport-level encryption, but not production-level service level agreements (SLAs).

If you need production-level SLAs for push notifications, you can either compile your own push-proxy service, with your own key, or you can use a paid option and become a Mattermost Professional subscriber `agreeing to our Conditions of Use <https://mattermost.com/terms-of-use/>`_, which enables you to use a production-level Hosted Push Notification Service (HPNS) at ``https://push.mattermost.com``.
