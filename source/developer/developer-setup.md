Developer Machine Setup
-----------------------------

If you run into any issues getting your environment set up, please check the Troubleshooting section at the bottom for common solutions.

### Mac OS X ###

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
2. Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` 
  - `127.0.0.1 dockerhost`
3. [Download Go 1.6](http://golang.org/dl/) (Go 1.5 and earlier is not supported) and Node.js using Homebrew.
	1. Download Homebrew from [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)
	2. `brew install go`
	3. `brew install node`
4. Set up your Go workspace
	1. `mkdir ~/go`
	2. Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`  
		- `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`  
		- `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`  
		- `ulimit -n 8096`  
		- If you don't increase the file handle limit you may see some weird build issues with browserify or npm.  
	3. Reload your bash profile  
		`source ~/.bash_profile`
	4. Set GOROOT (optional) in your `~/.bash_profile`
		- `export GOROOT=/usr/local/go/`
5. Fork Mattermost on GitHub.com from [https://github.com/mattermost/platform](https://github.com/mattermost/platform), then:
	1. `cd ~/go`  
	2. `mkdir -p src/github.com/mattermost`  
	3. `cd src/github.com/mattermost`  
	4. `git clone https://github.com/<username>/platform.git`  
	5. `cd platform`
6. Run `make run` to start Mattermost
7. Browse to `http://localhost:8065` to create an account. The first account created has System Administrator privileges.
8. You can stop Mattermost using `make stop`
9. If you want to setup for cross compilation (required for the `make package` and dependant targets) run:
    - Note: You can skip the platform you are on because you have that target installed by default.
    - `env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go install std`
    - `env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go install std`
    - `env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go install std`

### Windows ###

1. Install and setup Docker
    1. If you are using Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, you may use Docker for Windows
        1. Install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
        2. Add the line `127.0.0.1 dockerhost` to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` using a text editor with administrator privileges
    2. For other Windows versions, or if you prefer to use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), use Docker Toolbox
        1. Install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
        2. Run the `Docker Quickstart Terminal` and let it configure the `default` machine
        3. Run `docker-machine ip default` in the terminal to get `default` IP
        4. Add the line `<Docker-IP> dockerhost` to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` using a text editor with administrator privileges
2. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
3. Download and install Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) 
4. Fork Mattermost on GitHub.com from [https://github.com/mattermost/platform](https://github.com/mattermost/platform), then:
    1. `cd ~/go`  
    2. `mkdir -p src/github.com/mattermost`  
    3. `cd src/github.com/mattermost`  
    4. `git clone https://github.com/<username>/platform.git`

    export PATH="/c/Program Files/go/bin":$PATH
    export PATH="/c/Program Files/nodejs":$PATH
    export PATH="/c/Program Files/Git/bin":$PATH    
    export GOROOT='c:\\Program Files\\go'
    export GOPATH='c:\\User\\<user-name\\go'
    export PATH="/c/Program Files/Docker Toolbox":$PATH #change the path accordingly if you are using Docker for Windows
    eval $(docker-machine env default) #skip this line if you are using Docker for Windows
    ```

7. Run `make run` to start Mattermost
8. You can now log in to Mattermost as the user you created in step 9
9. If you want to setup for cross compilation (required for the `make package` and dependant targets) run:
    - Note: You can skip the platform you are on because you have that target installed by default.
    - `env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go install std`

## Troubleshooting

### Build errors 

#### I get the following error when running `make run` on Mac OS X: "Cannot connect ot the Docker daemon"

If you have Docker Tools installed (as opposed to Docker for Mac), you need make sure `docker-machine` is running with the following:
```
docker-machine start dev
```

#### I get the following error when running `make run`: "Failed to ping db err:dial tcp 192.168.99.100:3306: getsockopt: connection refused"

It appears that your MySQL database isn't running. If you run `docker ps`, you should see a line like
```
ecb17c10973d    mysql:5.7  "/entrypoint.sh mysql"   2 weeks ago    Up 24 hours  0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp     mattermost-mysql
```
If not, running `make clean-docker` will remove all existing docker containers so that they'll be recreated next time you call `make run`.

#### I get the following error when running `make run`: "Error starting server, err:listen tcp :8065: bind: address already in use"

There's likely another Mattermost instance already running. You can use `make stop` to stop it before running `make run` again.

If there isn't another copy of Mattermost running and you need to change the port that Mattermost is running on, you can do so by changing the `ListenAddress` setting in the `ServiceSettings` section of `config/config.json`.

### Other errors 

#### I don't see any error messages, but I can't access `http://localhost:8065`

It's possible that the server reported an error, but it was missed because of all of the output from the Javascript compiler. Try running `make run-server` by itself to see its output. If you still don't see any error messages, continue to the next section.

#### I don't see anything logged to the console when Mattermost is running

You can enable console logging in the `LogSettings` section of your `config/config.json` by setting `EnableConsole` to `true`.

#### I can't log into Mattermost because I don't have an account

You can create an account using the following command:
```
go run mattermost.go -create_user -email="user@example.com" -password="mypassword"
```
Optionally, you can make that account a System Admin with the following command:
```
go run mattermost.go -assign_role -email="user@example.com" -role="system_admin system_user"
```
