Mattermost desktop applications are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

You can `download the apps directly from our download page <https://mattermost.com/apps>`__ and visit our `installation guides </install/desktop-app-install.html>`__ for help during setup and for troubleshooting tips.

This page provides a guide on how to customize and distribute your own Mattermost desktop app, and how to distribute the official Windows desktop app silently to end users, pre-configured with the server URL and other app settings.

Custom build configuration
--------------------------

You can customize and distribute your own Mattermost desktop application by configuring `src/common/config/buildConfig.ts <https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/blob/master/src/common/config/buildConfig.ts>`__.

1. Configure the desktop app's ``buildConfig.ts`` file. There are multiple parameters you can configure to customize the user experience:

``defaultTeams``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Description
    List of server URLs and their display names added to the desktop app by default, which the user cannot modify. Users can still add servers `through the Server Management page </deploy/desktop-app.html#enableservermanagement>`__ unless ``enableServerManagement`` is set to ``false``. 
    
    Expects an array of key-value pairs.

  Example
  
.. code-block:: none

      defaultTeams: [
        {
          name: 'example',
          url: 'https://example.com'
        },
        {
          name: 'mattermost',
          url: 'https://www.mattermost.com'
        }
      ]

``helpLink``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Description
    The URL of the help documentation in **Help > Learn More** menu bar item. If none is specified, the menu option is hidden.
    
    Expects a string.

  Examples

.. code-block:: none

      helpLink: 'https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/managing-desktop-app-servers.html'
      helpLink: ''

``enableServerManagement``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Description
    Controls whether users can add, edit, or remove servers on the app settings page. If set to false, at least one server must be specified for ``defaultTeams`` or else users cannot interact with any servers.
    
    Expects a boolean, true or false.

  Examples

.. code-block:: none

      enableServerManagement: true

2. To build the application, follow the `Mattermost Desktop Development Guide <https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/more-info/desktop/developer-setup/>`__.

Windows App: Pre-configuration and silent deployment
-----------------------------------------------------

You can distribute the official Windows desktop app silently to end users, pre-configured with the server URL. You can also set all the `app settings </messaging/managing-desktop-app-options.html>`__ except for the **Start app on login** option.

1. Download the latest Windows installer from the `Mattermost download page <https://mattermost.com/apps>`__.

2. Move the executable file into a shared place such as a file server.

3. To create a batch file in Windows:

  - Open a text editor of your choice, such as Notepad or Notepad++.
  - Copy and paste the following commands in the text file:

.. code-block:: none

      rem "Step 1: Install Mattermost desktop app silently into user's local disk"
      start \\SERVER\shared_folder\mattermost-setup-4.6.2-win.exe --silent

      if not exist "%APPDATA%\Mattermost" mkdir %APPDATA%\Mattermost

      rem "Step 2: Generate initial config.json into user's config directory"
      (
        echo {
        echo   "version": 2,
        echo   "teams": [
        echo     {
        echo       "name": "core",
        echo       "url": "https://community.mattermost.com",
        echo       "order": 0
        echo     }
        echo   ],
        echo   "showTrayIcon": true,
        echo   "trayIconTheme": "light",
        echo   "minimizeToTray": true,
        echo   "notifications": {
        echo     "flashWindow": 2,
        echo     "bounceIcon": true,
        echo     "bounceIconType": "informational"
        echo   },
        echo   "showUnreadBadge": true,
        echo   "useSpellChecker": true,
        echo   "enableHardwareAcceleration": true,
        echo   "autostart": true,
        echo   "spellCheckerLocale": "en-US",
        echo   "darkMode": false
        echo }
      ) > %APPDATA%\Mattermost\config.json

.. note::

  Instead of using this command to install the desktop app into a shared folder, you can also copy the executable to the folder before running it. This allows the shared folder to only require read-only permissions.

4. Save the text file with the extension ``.bat``. For instance, ``mattermost-app-install.bat``.
5. Use standard software asset management tools to distribute and deploy the batch file to each user.

Once run, the desktop app is added to the userâ€™s local directory, along with the pre-configured ``config.json`` file. The installer creates a shortcut for the desktop app in the user's start menu; if a zip version is used, you need to create the shortcut manually.

Windows App: Silently removing the app
---------------------------------------

To remove the app silently from a user's computer, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: none
  
  %userprofile%\AppData\local\Programs\mattermost-desktop\Uninstall Mattermost.exe /currentuser /S
    
.. note::
   The .exe needs to be closed when this command is run
