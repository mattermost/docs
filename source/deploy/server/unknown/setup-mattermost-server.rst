Before you start the Mattermost Server, you need to edit the configuration file. A default configuration file is located at ``/opt/mattermost/config/config.json``. 

We recommend taking a backup of this default config ahead of making changes:

.. code-block:: sh
        
    sudo cp /opt/mattermost/config/config.json /opt/mattermost/config/config.defaults.json 

.. include:: common-default-config-changes.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

.. include:: common-configure-support-email.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

After modifying the ``config.json`` configuration file, you can now start the Mattermost server:
	
.. code-block:: sh

    sudo systemctl start mattermost

Verify that Mattermost is running: curl ``http://localhost:8065``. You should see the HTML thatâ€™s returned by the Mattermost Server.

The final step, depending on your requirements, is to run sudo ``systemctl enable mattermost.service`` so that Mattermost will start on system boot.
