Deploying Mattermost via Azure Marketplace Solution Template
============================================================

Overview
--------

This documentation provides a guide for deploying Mattermost using an Azure
Marketplace Solution Template. The template provisions infrastructure in Azure
tailored to host the Mattermost application, enabling fast and reliable
deployment while ensuring scalability and security.

The Solution Template sets up the following components:

1. **Virtual Machine (Ubuntu):** Hosts the Mattermost application and its
   associated database, providing the computing environment required to run
   the system.
2. **Public IP Address:** Allows access to the Mattermost workspace over the
   public internet, enabling users to connect to the platform securely.
3. **Network Interface:** Facilitates communication between the Virtual Machine
   and other Azure resources through a defined network layer.
4. **Network Security Group:** Acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound
   and outbound traffic to protect the deployed resources from unauthorized
   access.
5. **Disk:** Provides persistent storage mounted to the Virtual Machine for
   storing files generated by Mattermost, including uploaded documents and
   system configurations.
6. **Virtual Network:** Creates a secure, isolated network environment for the
   deployed resources, enabling private and controlled connectivity between
   infrastructure components.

By following this documentation, you will be able to deploy Mattermost in Azure
and configure the foundational infrastructure required to start using the
platform immediately.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Deploying Mattermost via Azure Marketplace Solution Template
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these instructions to deploy your Mattermost instance using the Azure
Marketplace Solution Template. Each step is designed to guide you through
configuration and setup, from selecting the appropriate plan to accessing your
newly deployed instance.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Azure Marketplace Offer

Go to the **Mattermost VM Complete** offering in the Azure Marketplace by
clicking `this link <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-all-in-one>`_.

### Step 2: Select a Plan and Start Deployment

Select an available Mattermost plan from the dropdown menu, then click
**Create** to begin the configuration process.

### Step 3: Configure the Basics

This step includes several key configurations, all managed on a single screen
in Azure:

1. **Subscription:** Choose the Azure subscription you'd like to use.
2. **Resource Group:** Either select an existing resource group or create a new
   one.
3. **Region:** Select the deployment region for your Virtual Machine (e.g.,
   ``East US``, ``West Europe``).
4. **VM Name:** Provide a unique name for your Virtual Machine.
5. **First Administrator:** Input the desired *username* and *email* for the
   first admin of the Mattermost instance.
6. **Authentication Method:** Use **password** authentication for simplicity.

We recommend giving your VM a unique, meaningful name (e.g., your
organization's name).

### Step 4: Choose VM Size and Networking Configuration

1. **Virtual Machine Size:** Select a size that meets your needs:
   - For small teams or trials, the **D2s v3** size is prefilled and
     recommended.
   - Larger teams should explore more scalable deployment options, such as
     `Mattermost for AKS <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-operator>`_.
2. **DNS Prefix:** Enter a unique DNS name for the instance. This DNS will
   allow public access to your workspace. It is important that you do not
   already have a matching DNS name within your Azure subscription, or your
   deployment may fail later in the process.
3. **Networking:** Select or create a new Virtual Network and Subnet. Creating
   new values ensures smooth setup and prevents deployment conflicts.

### Step 5: Submit and Deploy

Once the configuration is complete, finalize by clicking **Create**. Azure will
take 5-10 minutes to provision the infrastructure and create your new
Mattermost instance. During this time, the necessary components (e.g., Virtual
Machine, Public IP, Network) are set up.

Once the deployment is complete:

- Navigate to the **Public IP Address** section of your resources.
- Locate a resource named ``<your VM name>-ip`` and click on it.
- Your DNS name will be listed under "DNS Name" in the "Essentials" pane.
- The DNS name is formatted as follows:
  ``<dns name you chose>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com`` (e.g.,
  ``myorg.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com``).

### Step 6: Log In to Your Mattermost Instance

Access your Mattermost deployment via the DNS name from your Public IP
resource. Use the admin email and password you set in Step 3 to log in.

username and password fields highlighted.

Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed Mattermost via the Azure
Marketplace Solution Template. You’re now ready to start managing your team
collaboration using Mattermost.
