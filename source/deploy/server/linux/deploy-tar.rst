You can install the Mattermost Server on any 64-bit Linux system using the tarball. This is the most flexible installation method, but it comes with the highest effort, typically favored by advanced system administrators. 

This Mattermost deployment includes 3 steps: download, install Mattermost server, and set up the server.

**Step 1: Download**

In a terminal window, ssh onto the system that will host the Mattermost Server. 

Using ``wget``, download the Mattermost Server release you want to install.

.. tab:: Latest release

  .. code-block:: sh

    wget https://releases.mattermost.com/10.6.1/mattermost-10.6.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz

.. tab:: Current ESR

  .. code-block:: sh

    wget https://releases.mattermost.com/10.5.2/mattermost-10.5.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz

.. tab:: Older releases

  If you are looking for an older release, Enterprise and Team Edition releases can be found in our :doc:`version archive </about/version-archive>` documentation.

**Step 2: Install Mattermost server**

Install the Mattermost Server by extracting the tarball, creating users and groups, and setting file/folder permissions. 

1. First extract the tarball:

  .. code-block:: sh

      tar -xvzf mattermost*.gz

2. Move the entire folder to the ``/opt`` directory (or whatever path you require):

  .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mv mattermost /opt

.. note::

	If you choose a custom path, ensure this alternate path is used in all steps that follow.

3. Create the default storage folder. By default the Mattermost Server uses ``/opt/mattermost/data`` as the folder for files. This can be changed in the System Console during setup (even using alternative storage such as S3).

  .. code-block:: sh
      
      sudo mkdir /opt/mattermost/data

4. Set up a user and group called ``mattermost``:

  .. code-block:: sh

    sudo useradd --system --user-group mattermost

.. note::

	If you choose a custom user and group name, ensure it is used in all the steps that follow.

5. Set the file and folder permissions for your installation:

  .. code-block:: sh

    sudo chown -R mattermost:mattermost /opt/mattermost

6. Give the ``mattermost`` group write permissions to the application folder:

  .. code-block:: sh

    sudo chmod -R g+w /opt/mattermost

You will now have the latest Mattermost Server version installed on your system. Starting and stopping the Mattermost Server is done using ``systemd``. 

7. Create the systemd unit file:

  .. code-block:: sh

    sudo touch /lib/systemd/system/mattermost.service

8. As root, edit the systemd unit file to add the following lines:

  .. code-block:: text

      [Unit]
      Description=Mattermost
      After=network.target

      [Service]
      Type=notify
      ExecStart=/opt/mattermost/bin/mattermost
      TimeoutStartSec=3600
      KillMode=mixed
      Restart=always
      RestartSec=10
      WorkingDirectory=/opt/mattermost
      User=mattermost
      Group=mattermost
      LimitNOFILE=49152

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

.. note::

	If you are installing the Mattermost server on the same system as your database, you may want to add both ``After=postgresql.service`` and ``BindsTo=postgresql.service`` to the ``[Unit]`` section of the systemd unit file.

9. Save the file and reload systemd using ``sudo systemctl daemon-reload``. Mattermost Server is now installed and is ready for setup.

**Step 3: Set up the server**

Before you start the Mattermost Server, you need to edit the configuration file. A default configuration file is located at ``/opt/mattermost/config/config.json``. We recommend taking a backup of this default config ahead of making changes:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo cp /opt/mattermost/config/config.json /opt/mattermost/config/config.defaults.json 

Configure the following properties in this file:

* Under ``SqlSettings``, set ``DriverName`` to ``"postgres"``. This is the default and recommended database for all Mattermost installations.
* Under ``SqlSettings``, set ``DataSource`` to ``"postgres://mmuser:<mmuser-password>@<host-name-or-IP>:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10"`` replacing ``mmuser``, ``<mmuser-password>``, ``<host-name-or-IP>`` and ``mattermost`` with your database name.
* Under ``ServiceSettings``, set ``"SiteURL"``: The domain name for the Mattermost application (e.g. ``https://mattermost.example.com``).

We recommend configuring the `Support Email <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#support-email>`_ under ``SupportSettings``, set ``"SupportEmail"``. This is the email address your users will contact when they need help.

After modifying the ``config.json`` configuration file, you can now start the Mattermost server:
	
.. code-block:: sh

  sudo systemctl start mattermost

Verify that Mattermost is running: curl ``http://localhost:8065``. You should see the HTML thatâ€™s returned by the Mattermost Server.

The final step, depending on your requirements, is to run sudo ``systemctl enable mattermost.service`` so that Mattermost will start on system boot.

**Step 4: Update the server**

Updating your Mattermost Server installation when using the tarball requires several manual steps. See the :doc:`upgrade Mattermost Server </upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server>` documentation for details.

**Remove Mattermost**

To remove the Mattermost Server for any reason, you must stop the Mattermost Server, back up all important files, and then run this command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo rm - rf /opt/mattermost

.. note::

	Depending on your configuration, there are several important folders in ``/opt/mattermost`` to backup. These are ``config``, ``logs``, ``plugins``, ``client/plugins``, and ``data``. We strongly recommend you back up these locations before running the ``rm`` command.

You may also remove the Mattermost systemd unit file and the user/group created for running the application.
