Quick Start Evaluation
======================

This guide provides instructions for quickly trying out Mattermost using either Docker or Azure Marketplace. These options are ideal for testing and evaluation purposes as they allow you to quickly get a Mattermost instance up and running for exploration and testing. However, these quick start options are not recommended for production use. They are configured for demonstration purposes only.

Deployment options
------------------

.. tab:: Azure Marketplace

    Mattermost is available as a pre-configured virtual machine image in the Azure Marketplace. This option is preferred for customers already using Azure, as it integrates seamlessly within their existing Azure infrastructure.

    **Prerequisites:**

    * An Azure subscription
    * Basic familiarity with Azure Portal

    The Solution Template sets up the following components:

    1. **Virtual Machine (Ubuntu):** Hosts the Mattermost application and its associated database, providing the computing environment required to run the system.
    2. **Public IP Address:** Allows access to the Mattermost workspace over the public internet, enabling users to connect to the platform securely.
    3. **Network Interface:** Facilitates communication between the Virtual Machine and other Azure resources through a defined network layer.
    4. **Network Security Group:** Acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to protect the deployed resources from unauthorized access.
    5. **Disk:** Provides persistent storage mounted to the Virtual Machine for storing files generated by Mattermost, including uploaded documents and system configurations.
    6. **Virtual Network:** Creates a secure, isolated network environment for the deployed resources, enabling private and controlled connectivity between infrastructure components.

    **Step 1: Navigate to the Azure Marketplace Offer**

    Go to the **Mattermost VM Complete** offering in the Azure Marketplace by clicking `this link <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-all-in-one>`_.

    **Step 2: Select a Plan and Start Deployment**

    Select an available Mattermost plan from the dropdown menu, then click **Create** to begin the configuration process.

    **Step 3: Configure the Basics**

    This step includes several key configurations, all managed on a single screen
    in Azure:

    1. **Subscription:** Choose the Azure subscription you'd like to use.
    2. **Resource Group:** Either select an existing resource group or create a new one.
    3. **Region:** Select the deployment region for your Virtual Machine (e.g., ``East US``, ``West Europe``).
    4. **VM Name:** Provide a unique name for your Virtual Machine.
    5. **First Administrator:** Input the desired *username* and *email* for the first admin of the Mattermost instance.
    6. **Authentication Method:** Use **password** authentication for simplicity.

    We recommend giving your VM a unique, meaningful name (e.g., yourorganization's name).

    **Step 4: Choose VM Size and Networking Configuration**

    1. **Virtual Machine Size:** For trials, we recommend the **D2s v3** size. For Production use, we recommend a more scalable deployment option, such as `Mattermost for AKS <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-operator>`_.
    2. **DNS Prefix:** Enter a unique DNS name for the instance. This DNS will allow public access to your workspace. It is important that you do not already have a matching DNS name within your Azure subscription, or your deployment may fail later in the process.
    3. **Networking:** Select or create a new Virtual Network and Subnet. Creating new values ensures smooth setup and prevents deployment conflicts.

    **Step 5: Submit and Deploy**

    Once the configuration is complete, finalize by clicking **Create**. Azure will take 5-10 minutes to provision the infrastructure and create your new Mattermost instance. During this time, the necessary components (e.g., Virtual Machine, Public IP, Network) are set up.

    Once the deployment is complete:

    - Navigate to the **Public IP Address** section of your resources.
    - Locate a resource named ``<your VM name>-ip`` and click on it.
    - Your DNS name will be listed under "DNS Name" in the "Essentials" pane.
    - The DNS name is formatted as follows:

    ``<dns name you chose>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com`` (e.g.,
    ``myorg.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com``).

    **Step 6: Log In to Your Mattermost Instance**

    Access your Mattermost deployment via the DNS name from your Public IP resource. Use the admin email and password you set in Step 3 to log in.

    Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed Mattermost via the Azure Marketplace Solution Template. You’re now ready to start managing your team collaboration using Mattermost.

.. tab:: Docker Preview Container

    The fastest way to try Mattermost is using the official Docker preview container. This method requires minimal setup and provides a fully functional Mattermost instance.

    **Prerequisites:**

    * Docker installed on your system
    * At least 1GB of available RAM
    * At least 1GB of available disk space

    **Steps to run Mattermost using Docker:**

    1. Pull and run the Mattermost preview container:

        .. code-block:: bash
        
            docker run --name mattermost-preview -d --publish 8065:8065 mattermost/mattermost-preview

    2. Access Mattermost at ``http://localhost:8065``

    3. Create your first admin account when prompted.

Next steps
----------

After setting up your Mattermost instance using either method:

* Create your first team and channels
* Invite users to join your workspace
* Explore Mattermost features and integrations
* Review the :doc:`Application architecture </deploy/application-architecture>` to understand the system better
* Consider :doc:`Server deployment </deploy/server/server-deployment-planning>` for a production deployment
