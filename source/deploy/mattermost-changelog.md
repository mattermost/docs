 - An optional dedicated filestore is now used for compliance exports if configured (Cloud Enterprise plan).
 - ``MessageExportSettings.GlobalRelaySettings.CustomerType`` now supports "CUSTOM".

 - Added a new mmctl command ``oauth list`` for listing registered OAuth2 applications.

### Bug Fixes

### config.json
 - Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``RefreshPostStatsRunTime`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``RefreshPostStatsRunTime`` to add last login timestamp for users and to add materialized view and refresh job to keep track of post stats for PostgreSQL.
  
#### Changes to the Enterprise plan:

### Go Version

 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Fixed data retention policies to run jobs when any custom retention policy is enabled even when the global retention policy is set to **keep-forever**. Before this fix, the enabled custom data retention policies wouldn’t run as long as the global data retention policy was set to **keep-forever** or was disabled. After the fix, the custom data retention policies will run automatically even when the global data retention policy is set to **keep-forever**. Once the server is upgraded, posts may unintentionally be deleted. Admins should make sure to disable all custom data retention policies before upgrading, and then re-enable them again after upgrading.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v9.1, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Compatibility
 - Updated minimum required Edge version to 116+.

### Improvements

See [this walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udC2OCTGooc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Mattermost) on some of the improvements in our latest release below.

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Improved readability by displaying system messages on multiple lines when editing a channel header.
 - Combined "joined/left" event types in system messages.
 - Added a new user preference to disable webapp prefetching via **Settings > Advanced > Allow Mattermost to prefetch channel posts**. You must enable **Client Performance Debugging** in the System Console by going to **Environment > Developer** in order for this setting to appear. This setting and Client Performance Debugging should only be enabled temporarily if users are experiencing performance issues.
 - Pre-packaged NPS plugin version [v1.3.3](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-nps/releases/tag/v1.3.3).
 - Pre-packaged Todo plugin version [v0.7.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-todo/releases/tag/v0.7.1).

#### Administration
 - JSON null value cases are now handled correctly by also checking that the pointer is no longer null when unmarshalling to a pointer.
 - An annotated logger is now used to capture LDAP and SAML logs.
 - Replaced ``github.com/mattermost/gziphandler`` with ``github.com/klauspost/compress/gzhttp``.
 - Performance metrics now contain information on if a given request was sent during a page load or a websocket reconnect.
 - Elasticsearch aggregation jobs no longer start when a bulk indexing job is currently running.
 - Added heap profile, CPU profile, and goroutines profile to the support package.
 - Merged WIP i18n locales, but disallowed selecting unsupported locales.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed a panic where a simple worker would crash if it failed to get a job.
 - Fixed post props on update to properly see channel links.
 - Fixed an issue where the API for drafts would return empty drafts.
 - Fixed the alignment of the **Help** menu in the global header.
 - Fixed a broken link in the **Edit Channel** header modal.
 - Fixed an issue that prevented users to be added to channels from the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue where the channel member count increased when adding an already present user.
 - Fixed an issue where plugin developers were unable to create a ``textarea`` in interactive dialogs.
 - Fixed an issue where copy pasting images from Chrome failed.

### config.json
 - Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``LogSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added a new configuration setting ``MaxFieldSize`` to add the ability to size-limit log fields during logging.

### API Changes
 - Added ``origin_client`` to the ``mattermost_api_time`` metrics.

### Go Version
 - v9.2 is built with Go ``v1.20.7``.

### Known Issues
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
