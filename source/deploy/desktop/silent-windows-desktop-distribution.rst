Silent Windows desktop distribution
=====================================

You can distribute the official Windows desktop app silently to end users, pre-configured with the server URL. Additionally, you can customize all of the :doc:`desktop app settings </preferences/customize-desktop-app-experience>`, except the **Start app on login** option.

.. tip::

  Want to :ref:`perform a silent installation of the desktop app MSI <deploy/desktop/desktop-msi-installer-and-group-policy-install:silent installation>` instead? 

1. Download the latest Windows installer from the `Mattermost download page <https://mattermost.com/apps>`__.

2. Move the executable file into a shared place such as a file server.

3. To create a batch file in Windows:

  - Open a text editor of your choice, such as Notepad or Notepad++.
  - Copy and paste the following commands in the text file:

    .. code-block:: text

          rem "Step 1: Install Mattermost desktop app silently into user's local disk"
          start \\SERVER\shared_folder\mattermost-setup-4.6.2-win.exe --silent

          if not exist "%APPDATA%\Mattermost" mkdir %APPDATA%\Mattermost

          rem "Step 2: Generate initial config.json into user's config directory"
          (
            echo {
            echo   "version": 2,
            echo   "teams": [
            echo     {
            echo       "name": "core",
            echo       "url": "https://community.mattermost.com",
            echo       "order": 0
            echo     }
            echo   ],
            echo   "showTrayIcon": true,
            echo   "trayIconTheme": "light",
            echo   "minimizeToTray": true,
            echo   "notifications": {
            echo     "flashWindow": 2,
            echo     "bounceIcon": true,
            echo     "bounceIconType": "informational"
            echo   },
            echo   "showUnreadBadge": true,
            echo   "useSpellChecker": true,
            echo   "enableHardwareAcceleration": true,
            echo   "autostart": true,
            echo   "spellCheckerLocale": "en-US",
            echo   "darkMode": false
            echo }
          ) > %APPDATA%\Mattermost\config.json

4. Save the text file with the extension ``.bat``. For instance, ``mattermost-app-install.bat``.
5. Use standard software asset management tools to distribute and deploy the batch file to each user.

Once run, the desktop app is added to the userâ€™s local directory, along with the pre-configured ``config.json`` file. The installer creates a shortcut for the desktop app in the user's start menu; if a zip version is used, you need to create the shortcut manually.

.. tip::

  You can copy the executable to the folder before running it instead of using this command to install the desktop app into a shared folder. This allows the shared folder to only require read-only permissions.

Windows App: Silently removing the app
---------------------------------------

To remove the app silently from a user's computer, you can run the following command with the .exe file closed:

.. code-block:: text

  %userprofile%\AppData\local\Programs\mattermost-desktop\Uninstall Mattermost.exe /currentuser /S
