To install the `Mattermost for Microsoft Teams </plugins/mattermost-for-microsoft-teams>`__ plugin in Mattermost:

1. Log in to your Mattermost workspace as a system administrator.
2. Download the latest version of `the plugin binary release <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-sync/releases>`__, compatible with Mattermost v8.0.1 and later. 

  .. tip::

    If you are using an earlier version of Mattermost, `follow our documentation </upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html>`__ to upgrade to Mattermost v8.0.1 or later.

3. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management > Upload Plugin**, and upload the plugin binary you downloaded in the previous step.
4. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management**. In the **Installed Plugins** section, scroll to **MS Teams Sync**, and select **Enable Plugin**.

Configure how users will connect accounts
------------------------------------------

Mattermost admins can configure Mattermost to automatically prompt users to connect their Mattermost user account to their Microsoft Teams user account on login.

1. Go to **System Console > Plugins > MS Teams Sync**.
2. Enable **Enforce connected accounts** to prompt users to connect if they haven't done so.
3. (Optional) Enable **Allow to temporarily skip connect user** to allow users to skip the connection prompt temporarily. Users are prompted on refresh and login.

Configure the plugin

Additional configuration settings are available for this plugin. See the `MS Teams Sync plugin configuration settings </configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#ms-teams-sync>`__ documentation for details.
