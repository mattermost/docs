Can I use Mattermost to add messaging functionality to my proprietary SaaS service?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mattermost is an open source, self-hosted alternative to proprietary SaaS services that lock in the data of users and customers.

While you're welcome to use the Mattermost source code under its open source license, Mattermost, Inc. does not offer support or technical advice for proprietary SaaS projects that result in customers potentially being paywalled from their data should they stop paying SaaS fees.

To learn more about why we strongly believe that users and customers should always have access to their data, please read `why we created Mattermost <https://mattermost.org/why-we-made-mattermost-an-open-source-slack-alternative/>`__.
