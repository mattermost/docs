Mattermost offers features through `Mattermost Professional and Mattermost Enterprise subscription plans <https://www.mattermost.com/pricing>`__. Your plan subscription determines what features you have access to. When choosing a subscription, you can choose the deployment type as self-hosted or Cloud. 

Mattermost self-hosted deployments require a license subscription key to be applied to access features in the Professional or Enterprise plans. Mattermost offers a `secure self-service Customer Portal <https://customers.mattermost.com>`__ where you can purchase and manage your Mattermost self-hosted subscription. When you complete the purchase process, a license key is generated. Please see :doc:`Self-hosted subscriptions </about/self-hosted-subscriptions>` for more details.

Mattermost Cloud is a software-as-a-service product. Start a free 30-day Mattermost Enterprise trial, to explore paid features. Please see :doc:`Cloud subscriptions </about/cloud-subscriptions>` for more details.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Are my credit card details safe?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `Stripe <https://stripe.com/payments>`__ and `Solupay <https://www.solupay.com/>`__ to process credit card transactions. We do not store any credit card details at any stage. Payments made by credit card are authenticated using `3D Secure <https://www.sc.com/bn/ways-to-bank/3d-secure-faq/>`__, which is PCI-DSS compliant.

Should you wish to make payment using another method, please contact our `Billing team <mailto:AR@mattermost.com>`__.

Why do I need to provide my name and physical address when purchasing a subscription?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost is a U.S. corporation and, therefore, all business we do is governed by the laws of the United States, in addition to the local laws wherever we are doing business. 

The United States has a number of export control regulations implemented to protect national security interests and to promote its foreign policy objectives. Based on these regulations, U.S. companies are prohibited from doing business with specific countries which have been embargoed by the U.S. government. They are also prohibited from exporting certain items to certain countries that have been sanctioned by the U.S. government. In addition, U.S. companies are prohibited from doing business with specific people and/or companies that have been named and listed by the U.S. government. 

In order to comply with these requirements, Mattermost must collect the name and physical address of all individuals and companies it does business with so that it can comply with the U.S. export controls regulations.

What does Mattermost do with this information?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information you provide is used for a screening process. There are two different purposes for screening: 

- One screening is to ensure against exports of certain restricted goods to countries that are embargoed. In our case, goods refer to our software that has encryption in it.
- The other screening is against people and companies. There are certain people and companies that the government has put on a list (the Denied Party List) that US companies are prohibited from doing any business with for various reasons. They could be terrorists, be on a terrorist watch list, could be helping finance terrorists, could be participating in human rights violations, etc. If they are on the Denied Party List, we are not able to do any business with them.

Who are the sanctioned people, companies, and entities?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains a list of sanctioned entities. Some examples include:

- Terrorists
- Banks or other financial institutions that are involved in financing terrorism
- Companies or people that have been involved in human or drug trafficking
- Organizations that have been sanctioned for human rights violations

This will also include people in violation of government contracts because of our business with the U.S. government. Individuals and Companies do not end up on the Denied Party List based on the country they live in but by their actions and conduct.

What does “physical address” mean for software that will be used in many places?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, the "physical address" is the location where the individual, who will be receiving the license key, is physically located and will be able to access the software for installation.

How is a user defined for subscriptions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the purpose of billing, a “user” is any account created in Mattermost that has not been deactivated by the System Administrator. You can see your user count for billing purposes from the System Console on the **Site Statistics** page under “Total Active Users”. Guests are also defined as users. 

Do I need to pay for deactivated users?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. If you deactivate a user, that user is not counted as an active user during your annual renewal process. You can deactivate users manually via the System Console, and also via Active Directory/LDAP synchronization, the mmctl tool, and the server APIs.

If you choose to pull SQL reports from the database to monitor individual activity to make deactivation decisions, and you are running under high user load, we recommend the reports are pulled from a read replica of the database.

Which features are affected when my subscription expires?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The affected features include, but are not limited to, the following:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Feature", "How it's affected", "What steps do I need to take?"

    "Elasticsearch", "Elasticsearch is automatically disabled and will start using the default database for indexing posts.", "None needed."
    "AD/LDAP, SAML SSO, Office 365 SSO, and Google SSO", "Login options are no longer provided on the sign-in page. Users who previously signed in with one of these methods are no longer able to.

    "Permissions", "Permissions are retained in the database in a frozen state and cannot be modified in the System Console.", "Use `mmctl </manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html#mmctl-permissions>`__ to reset permissions to default."
    "Guest accounts", "Guests that are not actively logged in are prevented from logging in. Guests who are actively logged in are able to use Mattermost until their session expires or they log out.", "None needed."
    
Is there a maximum number of users per subscription?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, there is no limit to the subscription value or number of users you can purchase per plan.

What happens if my department buys a Mattermost subscription and then central IT buys a high volume subscription that also covers my department?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost subscriptions and support benefits are per production instance.

When the subscription for your department's production instance expires, you can either discontinue your department's production instance and move to the instance hosted by central IT (which can optionally provision one or more teams for your department to control), or you can renew your subscription to maintain control of your department's instance (e.g., to configure or customize the system in a manner highly specific to your line-of-business) in addition to using the instance from central IT.
