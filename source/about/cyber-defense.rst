Cyber Defense
=============

In todayâ€™s escalating threat landscape, organizations must respond to cyber incidents with precision and speed. Security teams require trusted, efficient tools to manage incident response, offensive security testing, and continuous operations. Outdated collaboration tools can slow response times and hinder team coordination. Secure, centralized communication is essential to protect sensitive information and mitigate threats in high-stakes scenarios.

Mattermost offers a secure, on-premises collaboration platform designed for cybersecurity use cases. With features tailored for Out-of-Band Incident Response, Red Team operations, and SOC/CERT workflows, Mattermost integrates secure communication, workflow automation, and leading security tools to empower effective cyber defense.
