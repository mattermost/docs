Mattermost Deployments and Editions
===================================

Mattermost Deployment Options
------------------------------

Mattermost provides additional benefits in our commercial editions to support the hosting and growth needs of an organization. You can explore these commercial features through a `trial <https://mattermost.com/get-started/>`__ with Mattermost Self-Hosted or Mattermost Cloud deployment options.

Mattermost Self-Hosted 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mattermost Self-Hosted provides Mattermost within IT-controlled private environments in public clouds, including AWS and Azure, as well as on-premise in private clouds and virtual or physical servers.

Once you’ve downloaded and installed Mattermost within your preferred environment, you have the option to use it as-is, or you can access Mattermost's commercial features by starting a trial or purchasing a subscription. You can start a 30-day free Enterprise trial via **Main Menu > System Console > Edition and License > Start trial** or request a trial online at https://mattermost.com/trial/.

Mattermost Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mattermost Cloud delivers Mattermost as software-as-a-service in a highly secure, hosted environment designed for privacy-conscious enterprises and developer collaboration.

To get started with a 14-day free trial of Mattermost Cloud online, visit https://customers.mattermost.com/cloud/signup. Signing up requires you to create an account with a business email and specify a domain for the workspace. Once you sign up and create your workspace, a wizard will help you get started completing your profile, inviting team members, and integrating with your favorite developer tools.

Mattermost Editions
--------------------

The Mattermost platform is offered under four editions to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes.

Mattermost Enterprise Edition is the name for the binary of the Mattermost self-hosted Starter, Professional, and Enterprise plans. Mattermost Starter can be used for free without a subscription as commercial software that’s functionally equivalent to the open source Mattermost Team Edition licensed under MIT. When a subscription is purchased and applied to Mattermost Enterprise Edition, additional features unlock. The license agreement for Mattermost Enterprise Edition is included in the software and also available `here <https://mattermost.com/enterprise-edition-license/>`__.

Our open source, self-hosted Team Edition will remain free forever with features that align with our self-hosted Mattermost Starter plan. We do not currently offer a free edition of Mattermost Cloud, however, we provide it at a low cost to make it a valuable option for teams with budgetary limitations.

Self-hosted and Cloud deployments of the various Mattermost plans have equivalent features, aside from a few cases where a feature is specific to the deployment model. For example, Omnibus or Kubernetes deployment tools are only available for our self-hosted offering as they are specific to self-hosting Mattermost.

Mattermost Team Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Team Edition is a free-to-use, open source, self-hosted collaboration platform offering all the core productivity benefits of competing SaaS solutions. It deploys as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL under an MIT license.

The open-source Mattermost Team Edition is functionally identical to Mattermost Starter, but there is no ability to unlock additional features.

We generally recommend installing Mattermost Starter, even if you don't currently need a subscription. This provides the flexibility to seamlessly unlock additional features should you need them. However, if you only want to install software with a fully open-source code base, then Team Edition is the best choice for you.

To get started, `download the open-source Mattermost Team Edition server <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/version-archive.html#mattermost-team-edition-server-archive>`__ under an MIT license.

Packaging Decisions
----------------------------
As the platform matures and new features are added, they are evaluated to be included in the edition that best aligns with the organizational use cases outlined by the editions above. Multiple factors are considered in determining which tier to include a feature including mission-critical impact, relative value to a single team, cross-functional teams, and the enterprise, as well as security, compliance, and scalability.

We recognize there aren't any features that are only useful to managers, directors, and executives. Individual practitioners may want certain features; however, we think that other buyers are relatively more likely to care about it. We also recognize that there may be some features that are put into an edition to find later there is much demand for it by individuals or a singular team; we will not hesitate to move that feature. We value feedback from our community and iterate based on that feedback. Simultaneously, we also need to offer commercial products that hold value and do our best to find the right balance. We believe the more of Mattermost that you use, the more likely it is that you benefit from the advanced editions we offer. 

You can provide us feedback on `our forum <https://mattermost.uservoice.com/>`__, where ideas and input influences the future of the platform.
