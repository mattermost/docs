Video, audio, and screen sharing questions
==========================================

What support is available for video and audio calling and screen sharing?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our `Marketplace <https://mattermost.com/marketplace/>`__ has several integrations to connect by voice or video call, or to share your screen with team members in Mattermost.

You can learn more about the most popular options, including self-hosted on-prem, self-hosted private cloud solutions, and vendor-hosted SaaS solutions (e.g. SIP PBX, Zoom, and Skype for Business), also in our Marketplace.

Note that you can also neatly link video, audio and screensharing solutions, like Zoom and Skype for Business, to channels by using markdown formatting in the channel header. Example: ``[Click for video call](https://link_to_solution)``.
