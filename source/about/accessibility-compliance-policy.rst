Accessibility Compliance Policy
================================

Digital accessibility removes barriers to ensure full participation with digital experiences. People with disabilities may use assistive technology like screen readers or alternative input devices. We prioritize accessibility to deliver an experience that works for everyone, involving accessible designs, compatible code, and a logical, functional user interface for all.

This policy outlines our commitment to accessibility through the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), which documents our product's compliance with accessibility standards.

Policy and commitment
---------------------

At Mattermost, we strive to create a fair environment for everyone. We work continuously to ensure our digital products are accessible for all and are committed to following the W3C Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Guidelines and other applicable web accessibility laws including `WCAG 2.1 <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/>`_ Level AA (W3C) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (United States) for federal accessibility requirements. 

We leverage expert accessibility partners, such as `Level Access <https://www.levelaccess.com/>`_, to achieve and sustain conformance to accessibility standards. Their digital accessibility platform is used to evaluate our digital properties in accordance with best practices and is supported by a diverse team of accessibility professionals, including users with disabilities.

Scope
-----

This policy applies to all products offered by Mattermost, including web applications, software, digital content, and related services that may be used by individuals with disabilities. The policy applies to both internal and external stakeholders, including potential customers, partners, and government agencies seeking accessibility information.

VPAT creation process
---------------------

1. **Initial Assessment**: Each product is reviewed for accessibility compliance based on the relevant standards. This assessment is conducted by trained accessibility personnel or certified third-party auditors.

2. **VPAT Documentation**: A VPAT is created based on the findings from the initial assessment. This document details each accessibility criterion and the level of conformance achieved, along with explanations for any known gaps or alternative solutions.

3. **Review and Approval**: VPATs are reviewed by our accessibility compliance team to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Any areas not in full compliance are documented with explanations and, where possible, a roadmap for future improvements.

4. **Publishing and Distribution**: Once approved, VPATs are made available upon request for customers, partners, and other stakeholders.

Accessibility standards and regulations evolve, and our products and services continue to improve. VPATs will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, at minimum annually, to reflect the current state of our accessibility compliance.
