Maximize Your Microsoft Investment
===================================

Unlock the full potential of your Microsoft Teams, M365, and Entra ID investment with Mattermost. Designed for operational teams that require advanced customization, secure workflows, and seamless deployment on segregated networks, Mattermost enhances your existing Microsoft solutions for critical mission success.

On-prem Skype for Business replacement in classified operations
----------------------------------------------------------------

As Skype for Business is phased out, secure teams need a new communication solution that meets stringent air-gap and security standards. Mattermost operates entirely within your infrastructure, trusted in air-gapped environments, and integrates smoothly with Outlook and Azure AI to maintain secure operations while preserving full data control.

Intelligent incident response with MS Security Suite
-----------------------------------------------------

During high-stakes incidents, Microsoft 365 tools can be limited or unavailable, slowing down response times and jeopardizing mission continuity. Mattermost provides a secure, out-of-band solution that keeps your team connected, even if Microsoft systems go down. Integrates with Microsoft Security Suite and Entra ID for a seamless, fast response. With real-time chat, automated workflows, decision logs, and AI-powered summaries, your team can stay mission-ready under pressure.

External collaboration with enterprise control
----------------------------------------------------------------

Managing external collaboration within Microsoft Teams can be complex, often requiring numerous configurations and administrative workarounds that lead to security risks. Mattermost integrates directly into Microsoft Teams and Outlook, enabling secure, IT-approved external collaboration and mitigating the risk of consumer tool usage. This ensures compliance, centralizes communication, and provides enterprise-grade oversight through encryption, audit trails, and controls.

Sovereign communication channel in Microsoft Teams
-----------------------------------------------------

For government teams bound by compliance regulations, Mattermost offers a fully self-hosted solution that integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Teams and Outlook. This allows secure collaboration on sensitive data, ensuring it remains under your control and meets stringent compliance requirements while keeping teams within their familiar workflows.

Operations hub across Microsoft 365 instances
----------------------------------------------

Organizations often face challenges with secure, compliant collaboration when managing multiple Microsoft 365 instances across different agencies and mission partners. Mattermost provides a centralized platform that facilitates seamless, secure messaging, file sharing, and workflow integration, embedded within Microsoft Teams and Outlook. This solution reduces friction, simplifies cross-agency collaboration, and maintains full control over your data, ensuring smooth operations without compromising security.
