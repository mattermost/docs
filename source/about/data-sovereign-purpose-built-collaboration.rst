Data Sovereign Purpose-Built Collaboration
==========================================

In an era where control over data sovereignty is paramount, organizations need collaboration solutions designed to meet the strictest security, compliance, and operational requirements. Whether you’re managing air-gapped environments, inter-agency operations, or external collaborations that require enterprise-grade oversight, Mattermost ensures your communication and workflows are secure, reliable, and tailored for purpose-built collaboration. 

Mattermost addresses the unique challenges of data sovereignty and purpose-built collaboration through solutions engineered for high-security environments and specialized operational requirements with a fully sovereign, on-premises solution that enables organizations to retain complete control over their data while maintaining operational efficiency and fostering teamwork.

Use cases
-------------

Fully sovereign on-premise collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Organizations lack full control, security, and compliance over collaboration platforms, putting sensitive data and regulatory adherence at risk. Retain complete control over data while maintaining operational efficiency and fostering teamwork.

- **On-premises deployment**: Gain complete ownership and control of your collaboration infrastructure with a locally hosted deployment. Safeguard sensitive data and ensure compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations.

- **Kubernetes-compatible architecture**: Simplify deployment, scale easily, and administer IT operations through Kubernetes support, compatible with global and local cloud services such as AWS, Azure, or entirely air-gapped infrastructures.

- **STIG-hardened and FIPS 140-2 validated images**: Meet strict compliance mandates, including DISA and FedRAMP requirements, with secure system images designed for sensitive environments.

Operational technology – industrial control systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional collaboration tools are not secure, reliable, or tailored enough to support the unique needs of critical operational environments. Enhance communication and collaboration in operational technology (OT) environments, including industrial control systems (ICS), while ensuring data sovereignty and compliance.

- **Hardened communication for OT environments**: Support collaboration in operational technology settings, including industrial control systems (ICS), with secure, resilient messaging and file-sharing capabilities tailored for high uptime and operational reliability.

- **Robust fault tolerance**: Ensure uninterrupted communication for critical systems through high availability and disaster recovery options.

- **Customizable workflows**: Optimize operational coordination in ICS environments with collaborative playbooks and streamlined task management.

External collaboration with enterprise control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collaborating with external parties introduces security vulnerabilities and limits control over sensitive data and compliance. Enable secure external collaboration while maintaining enterprise oversight and compliance, allowing organizations to work with partners and vendors without compromising security.

- **Secure vendor and partner communication**: Enable collaboration with external parties without compromising enterprise security through private and shared channels with customizable access controls.

- **Data residency and compliance**: Retain sovereignty over data while enabling cross-organizational workflows through configurable permissions and secure integrations.

- **Federated communications**: Seamlessly connect Mattermost with third-party platforms like Microsoft Teams, enhancing enterprise control over external collaboration.

Inter-agency operations hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agencies face inefficiencies and silos due to the lack of a centralized, secure platform for real-time, multi-lingual coordination. Enhance inter-agency operations, enabling secure communication and workflow automation across diverse teams.

- **Centralized communication for agency efforts**: Create a secure, shared hub for real-time coordination and knowledge-sharing among agencies working on joint objectives.

- **Multi-language support**: Available in 22 languages, Mattermost facilitates collaboration across diverse agencies with localized options.

- **Workflow automation**: Drive efficiency with reusable, automated collaborative playbooks designed for incident response, logistics, and other operational workflows.

Air-gapped operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secure communication and collaboration are hindered in isolated, high-security environments that lack internet access. Enable secure collaboration and workflow automation in air-gapped environments, ensuring mission success without external dependencies.

- **Secure collaboration in isolated environments**: Enable communication and operational workflows in air-gapped, high-security environments with private deployments that do not require internet access.

- **Private mobility options**: Protect communications with ID-only push notifications, ensuring secure operations even on mobile devices.

- **Mission-critical tools**: Leverage tools like audio calling, file sharing, and screen sharing within air-gapped conditions for operational success.

Collaboration and workflow automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collaboration tools fail to provide seamless experiences, organizational customization, and actionable operational insights. Enhance collaboration and workflow automation to streamline communication and drive efficiency.

- **Channel-based messaging across devices**: Deliver seamless messaging, file sharing, and threaded discussions across web, desktop, and mobile—from Windows to macOS and iOS to Android.

- **Custom branding and application flexibility**: Tailor the look and feel of your collaboration platform to align with your organization’s identity while enabling integrations and extensions via APIs, webhooks, and custom plugins.

- **Operational insights and automations**: Harness data and integrations with platforms such as Jira, GitHub, ServiceNow, and others to turn collaboration into actionable insights.

Enterprise mobility for sensitive environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sensitive mobile operations are vulnerable to security risks and lack secure notification and mobility management tools. Enhance mobile accessibility while safeguarding sensitive operations through secure mobile workflows and notifications.

- **Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) for security**: Enhance mobile accessibility while safeguarding classified operations through support for AppConfig-compatible EMM tools.

- **Customizable alerts**: Replace sensitive push notification content with ID-only alerts secured through encrypted channels, maintaining operational integrity.
