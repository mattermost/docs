Illicit Use Questions
=====================

How do I report illicit use of Mattermost software? 
---------------------------------------------------

Illicit use of Mattermost software to harm others, infringe on their rights, break laws or policies is explicitly against our `Terms of Use <https://about.mattermost.com/default-terms/>`__.

If the illicit use is happening on a web address ending in ``“mattermost.com”``, it means the suspected perpetrators are using Mattermost software controlled by our company, Mattermost, Inc. In this case, please get in touch with us at ``support@mattermost.com`` to report the issue for us to investigate.

If the illicit use is happening on a different web address, then it means the suspected perpetrators may be using Mattermost software controlled by a person or company other than Mattermost, Inc. In this case, you need to contact the person or company who controls the web address by using a lookup service such as https://www.whois.net/ to find the contact email to report abuse. You can use a link to this FAQ as a reference to our `Terms of Use <https://about.mattermost.com/default-terms/>`__ policy for Mattermost software.
