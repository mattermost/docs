    You must `install the Microsoft Teams plugin in Mattermost </plugins/install-mattermost-for-microsoft-teams-plugin>`__ before you can install the Mattermost app in Microsoft Teams. 

To install the Mattermost app in Microsoft Teams:

1. In Mattermost, as an administrator, go to System Console > Plugins > Mattermost for Microsoft Teams. At the bottom of the settings page, select **Download Manifest** to download a ZIP file containing the Microsoft Teams application manifest pre-configured for your Mattermost workspace.
2. In Microsoft Teams, as an administrator, go to the Microsoft Teams admin center under **Teams Apps > Manage Apps**, or use the following URL: ``https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps``.
3. Select **Upload new app**, then upload the app manifest you downloaded in the previous step.

Youâ€™re all set! The Mattermost app is now available to everyone in your Microsoft Teams workspace.

Pin the Mattermost app in Microsoft Teams
------------------------------------------

1. Add the Mattermost app by selecting **Apps** within the left-hand sidebar, select **Add** located next to the Mattermost for Microsoft Teams app, then select **Add** again. Once added, your Mattermost workspace is now embedded in your Microsoft Teams instance. 
2. Pin the Mattermost app in your left-hand sidebar to access it easily in the future, by right-clicking the Mattermost tab and selecting **Pin**.
3. Sign in with your email/password credentials, and use the Mattermost app to collaborate with technical and operations teams.

Limitations
------------

The Mattermost app currently only supports email/password log in to the Mattermost workspace. SSO authentication with SAML 2.0 providers (Okta, OneLogin, Microsoft ADFS) and with your Microsoft365 account are under consideration.

Troubleshooting
----------------

If you face any issues while installing or using the app in Microsoft Teams, you can either:

- Open a new issue in the `Mattermost for Microsoft Teams GitHub repository <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-sync/issues/new>`__.
