Benefits of the embedded app
----------------------------

- **Improved reaction time in the event of an incident** by accessing alerting features in Mattermost directly from within Microsoft Teams.

  Mattermost is open-source and can be extensively customized to integrate with various system monitoring and alerting tools. If your tech team has set up unique alerting features in Mattermost, use the app to access these directly from within Teams, including system status updates, improving reaction time in the event of an incident.

- **Simplified workflows through a single interface** for communication and DevOps management.

  If your technical team uses specific DevOps tools (such as Jenkins, Jira, GitHub, etc.) that are tightly integrated with Mattermost, embedding Mattermost in Teams can give direct access to these integrated services. This simplifies workflows by providing a single interface for DevOps use cases.

- **Quickly run scripts within Microsoft Teams**.

  Mattermost supports the use of a CLI, which can be a major advantage for tech teams. If you need to run scripts or execute commands via Mattermost, embedding it within Teams allows you to use this functionality from either platform.

- **Embed custom functionality to accelerate technical workflows**.

  If your tech team has created custom bots and plugins that function with Mattermost, embedding it within Microsoft Teams will allow everyone to access these utilities. These may include custom bots for streamlining incident management, security operations and red/blue team workflows.

Limitations
------------

The embedded Mattermost app currently only supports email/password log in to the Mattermost workspace. SSO authentication with SAML 2.0 providers (Okta, OneLogin, Microsoft ADFS) and with your Microsoft365 account are under consideration.
