DevOps Collaboration
--------------------

In DevOps, teams work together to accelerate software development and deployment processes, reduce costs, and ensure their organization remains competitive in the fast-paced digital marketplace. DevOp practitioners include a variety of disciplines including product managers, designers, developers, operations, quality assurance, security, and project managers.

DevOps teams can experience the following collaboration pains: 

- Members from different departments and timezones have different priorities, skills, and vocabularies, which can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delays in decision-making.
- Limited visibility into each other's work can lead to duplication of effort, conflicts, and missed opportunities for optimization.
- Resistance from stakeholders who are reluctant to adopt new technologies or processes can slow down innovation, increase costs, and create tension within the team.
- Difficulty ensuring that software is developed, deployed, and managed securely to protect against data breaches and cyber-attacks. This involves coordinating efforts between developers, operations, and security teams to identify and mitigate security risks.

There are several different processes that DevOps teams need to effectively collaborate in order to deliver software reliably. Each requires a different set of procedures and tools, but they all share the common goal of shipping high-quality software to meet customer needs and expectations. Mattermost can help solve collaboration pains in many DevOps use cases.
