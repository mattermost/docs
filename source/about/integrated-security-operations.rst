Integrated Security Operations
==============================

In today’s evolving threat landscape, fragmented workflows, isolated teams, and disjointed tools create delays and blind spots in organizational defense. As threats scale across geopolitical, cyber, and supply chain domains, security operations must become more integrated—unifying monitoring, simulation, response, and intelligence into a continuous, coordinated system.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible platform for integrated security operations—built to support real-time coordination, mission-specific tooling, and sensitive communications. Whether in Security Operations Centers (SOCs), red team engagements, CERT responses, or cross-organizational intelligence hubs, Mattermost empowers security teams to accelerate detection, decision-making, and coordinated response while maintaining full operational control.

The following integrated SecOps capabilities are available:

Security Operations Centers (SOCs)
----------------------------------

SOCs are the front lines of real-time monitoring, triage, and escalation. Coordinating across analysts, tools, and environments requires fast, structured communication and secure data handling.

**Benefits**

- **Accelerate triage and response workflows** with :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </guides/repeatable-processes>` that automate escalations, task assignment, and ticket updates for consistent response execution.
- **Integrate detection pipelines and observability tools** using the :doc:`Mattermost integrations platform </about/integrations>` to surface alerts from SIEM, SOAR, and log analysis systems into dedicated response channels.
- **Maintain operational security and compliance** through :doc:`role-based permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`audit logging <manage/logging:audit logging>` to safeguard sensitive incident data.
- **Operate in secure, classified, or hybrid environments** with :ref:`self-hosted deployment models <deploy/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` that keep SOC operations inside compliant, sovereign infrastructure.

Red Teams
---------

Adversary simulation exercises require stealth, control, and segmented communications across tools and stakeholders.

**Benefits**

- **Coordinate covert engagements securely** using :ref:`private channels <collaborate/channel-types:private channels>` and :doc:`threaded messaging </collaborate/organize-conversations>` to maintain operational compartmentalization during offensive scenarios.
- **Control exposure and data lineage** with :doc:`custom retention policies </comply/data-retention-policy>` and :ref:`channel-level access controls <manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` that align with internal red team governance.
- **Simulate real-world attacks across tools** using :doc:`custom integrations </about/integrations>` that connect Mattermost with infrastructure like C2 frameworks, vulnerability scanners, and operational support tools.
- **Run red/blue postmortems and hotwash debriefs** in controlled collaboration spaces that preserve findings, artifacts, and replayable insights.

Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs)
-----------------------------------------

CERTs serve as rapid-response teams during high-risk events, requiring tight coordination, reliable workflows, and cross-unit information flow.

**Benefits**

- **Orchestrate high-stakes incident response** through :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </guides/repeatable-processes>` tailored for malware outbreaks, data exfiltration events, and zero-day exploits.
- **Centralize and structure communication** with :doc:`channel-based collaboration </guides/collaborate>`, including :doc:`file sharing </collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`, :doc:`threaded updates </collaborate/organize-conversations>`, and task-tracking across affected teams.
- **Enable coordination across geographies** using :doc:`multi-device access </guides/deployment-guide>` and :doc:`mobile EMM support </deploy/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>` for secure participation across locations and devices.
- **Preserve evidentiary and compliance data** through :ref:`audit logs <manage/logging:audit logging>` and configurable :doc:`exports </manage/bulk-export-tool>` for legal review or forensic handoff.

Federated Threat Intelligence & Information Sharing
---------------------------------------------------

Cross-organizational threat intelligence teams—spanning sectors, regions, and public-private partnerships—require secure, policy-driven platforms for sharing indicators, coordinating alerts, and supporting collective defense efforts.

**Benefits**

- **Collaborate securely across agencies or organizations** using :doc:`Connected Workspaces </onboard/connected-workspaces>` to synchronize alerts, discussions, and file sharing with trusted external partners.
- **Support multinational and sectoral collaboration** with :doc:`custom terms of service enforcement </comply/custom-terms-of-service>` and :ref:`localized UI settings <preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>` for global partner access.
- **Preserve operational trust and compliance** through :doc:`role-based access controls </onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`channel-specific permissions <manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` that enforce jurisdictional and information-sharing agreements.
- **Operationalize shared threat intelligence** by integrating IOCs, threat actor profiles, and shared playbooks into your Mattermost instance via the :doc:`integrations platform </about/integrations>`.
