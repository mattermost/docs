Dependency Vulnerability Analysis
==================================

This document provides context on why certain third-party dependencies in Mattermost, although flagged as vulnerable by security scanners, do not pose a risk in Mattermost deployments.

This analysis is regularly updated as new vulnerability reports are received and evaluated.

Overview
--------

Mattermost regularly scans its dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Some dependencies may be flagged as vulnerable by security scanners, but these vulnerabilities might not be applicable to Mattermost due to:

* How the dependency is used in Mattermost
* The specific version or configuration implemented
* Mitigations already in place
* False positives in the scanning process
