Non-profit subscriptions
========================

The Mattermost Nonprofit License enables nonprofit and open-source organizations who are unable to afford our commercial licenses to apply the benefits of the self-hosted :ref:`Mattermost Professional offering <about/editions-and-offerings:mattermost professional>` towards advancing their missions with special nonprofit pricing.

.. tip::

  Nonprofit and open-source organizations that meet the `eligibility requirements <#who-s-eligible>`_ can apply for the Mattermost Nonprofit license by completing `this form <https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=17664739497236>`_.

What's included?
-----------------

A 3-year subscription to our Mattermost Professional Self-Hosted offering for up to 1,000 users with a subscription fee of $250 USD. If the nonprofit has over 1,000 users, the application will undergo a review on a case-by-case basis, both for Mattermost Professional Self-Hosted and Mattermost Professional Cloud offerings. Upon acceptance of these terms, Mattermost has the right to place the name and logo of the nonprofit, open-source, or charitable institution on our website and in our marketing materials.

Following the 3-year subscription, the institution can renew the license every 3 years for an additional $250 USD subscription fee.
