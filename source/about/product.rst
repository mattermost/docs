Stay connected with channels
-----------------------------

Channel-based communication workflows require real-time information sharing, flexibility, and ad hoc activities where the life cycle of communication workflows is typically measured in seconds to hours.

:doc:`Mattermost </guides/collaborate>` enables you to organize your teamâ€™s real-time 1:1 and group communications with an unlimited and fully searchable message history. Share materials such as files, images, links; share sentiments with emojis and GIFs; and express ideas with rich markdown formatting, code syntax highlighting, and multi-language support. Facilitate face-to-face connections with integrated voice/video conferencing. Mattermost channels are ideal for bug triage, daily standups, posting announcements, and team conversations.

Trust your proceses with playbooks
-----------------------------------

Structured workflows are specific scenarios and use cases that require a reliable and repeatable process. These use cases lend themselves well to shared checklists, automation, and retrospectives where the life cycle is measured in hours to weeks. Some examples include incident collaboration and software releases.

:doc:`Collaborative playbooks </guides/repeatable-processes>` streamline complex, recurring processes that enable teams to achieve a specific and predictable outcome. Orchestrate prescribed workflows with built-in checklists, triggers, automation, tool integrations, and retrospectives. Increase stakeholder visibility with status updates and cumulative statistics. Customize a playbook to align with organizational practices, and adjust on the fly to respond quickly in highly dynamic situations. Playbooks are critical in incident collaboration to avoid and minimize costly business disruptions, and in software release processes to ship high-quality software on time.
