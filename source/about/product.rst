About the Mattermost Open Source Project
-----------------------------------------

At its core, Mattermost is an open source, hybrid cloud alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging for teams. The software, developed in partnership with over 500 contributors from around the world, is designed to increase the agility, efficiency and innovation in high trust organizations while keeping data and operations under IT control.

Core committers, including both community contributors and paid staff at Mattermost, Inc., determine the project roadmap. For enterprises with needs beyond the scope of the open source project, commercial "Enterprise Edition" extensions are available from Mattermost, Inc. Partnership with our core committer community, along with revenue from Enterprise Edition, ensures the continued improvement of all editions.

Mattermost Team Edition
-----------------------

A free-to-use, open source, self-hosted alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging. Team Edition is your open source "virtual office", offering all the core productivity benefits of competing SaaS solutions. It deploys as single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL under an MIT license.

The open source Mattermost Team Edition is functionally identical to the commercial Mattermost Enterprise Edition in its free “team mode”, but there is no ability to unlock enterprise features.

We generally recommend installing Enterprise Edition, even if you don't currently need a license. This provides the flexibility to seamlessly unlock Enterprise features should you need them. However, if you only want to install software with a fully open source code base, then Team Edition is the best choice for you.

Features include:

- One-to-one and group messaging, file sharing, and unlimited search history
- Native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux
- Threaded messaging, emoji, and custom emoji
- Tools for custom branding
- Continuous archiving

- Easily scalable to dozens of users per team
- `Runtime profiling data and system monitoring reports <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/metrics.html#standard-go-metrics>`__

This intentional isolation and dedicated deployment supports other privacy-centric features, such as VPC Peering, bring-your-own-domain and certificates, mutual TLS, access to monitoring tools, databases to run custom analysis, and more.
