Skype For Business Replacement
===============================

With Skype for Business reaching its end-of-life (EOL), classified operations face the urgent need to transition to a new communication platform. Migrating to cloud-based solutions is not always viable due to air-gap requirements and strict security and compliance mandates. Operational inefficiencies and the inability to meet the evolving demands of mission IT workflows pose risks to productivity, security, and adaptability in critical situations. A smooth transition to a collaboration solution is essential to ensure that classified operations continue without disruptions while maintaining their security.

Mattermost provides a secure on-premises communication solution that meets the rigorous demands of classified operations. Its platform is designed to offer reliable and secure messaging, file sharing, and collaboration tools — all of which are crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive communications. Mattermost ensures compliance with strict security protocols and offers customizable features to optimize operational workflows. 

Key features
-------------

- **STIG-hardened DISA-approved image**: Mattermost is also available with STIG-hardened Chainguard images scanned against the DISA General Purpose Operating System Security Requirements Guide (SRG). These images meet stringent security requirements necessary for classified operations. 

- **Private, air-gapped AI operations**: Mattermost enables mission-critical communication and workflows in private, air-gapped environments, alongside capabilities like audio calling, transcription, screen sharing, analysis, and workflow management. 

On-premises flexibility and high availability
