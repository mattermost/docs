Cloud subscriptions
===================

Buy a Cloud subscription
------------------------

Mattermost Cloud can be used free forever with Mattermost Free.

You can also start a free, 30-day trial of Mattermost Enterprise to explore additional features. When you're near the end of your trial, a banner within Mattermost will notify you to upgrade to a subscription plan:

1. Select **Subscribe now**.
2. Provide your credit card details.

.. note::
  
  Your credit card will be verified and you'll be charged at the end of the billing period. If you'd prefer an annual Cloud subscription, please contact our `Sales team <mailto:sales@mattermost.com>`_ for a quote.
3. Provide your billing address.
4. (Optional) Select a subscription plan.
5. Select **Subscribe**.

Alternatively, if you'd like to continue with Mattermost Enterprise, please contact our `Sales team <mailto:sales@mattermost.com>`_. 

If you choose not to upgrade at the end of your 30-day trial, your subscription will revert to Mattermost Free.

View subscription information
-----------------------------

The subscription screen outlines the details of your Mattermost Cloud account, including the cost per user per month and the number of users currently registered in your workspace. You can also find a summary of your last invoice in the same page, and any `workspace limits </onboard/mattermost-limits.html>`__ set for your subscription.

Billing period
--------------

After you begin your Mattermost Cloud paid subscription, your first charge is applied at the end of the calendar month. Subsequent billing periods begin at 12 AM UTC on the first day of each calendar month and end at 11:59 PM UTC on the final day of the same calendar month. Per-user pricing for each billing period will be based on the number of registered users.

Invoices appear immediately after the billing period ends.

It may take up to a day for our billing systems to calculate, charge your credit card, and issue your invoice. Once charges are completed, the invoice will show as *Paid*. The invoice is a downloadable PDF file.

If there's a payment failure, your invoice will show *Payment Failed*. Please review the accuracy of your credit card information in **Payment Information**. Unresolved failed payments may result in a delinquency and an interruption to your subscription.

Adding and removing users in the middle of a billing period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add new users in the middle of a billing cycle, you'll only be charged for the days that the user is registered.

Here's an example:

Your organization has a Mattermost Cloud workspace, and you're on a monthly subscription at the rate of $10 USD per user per month. You add a new user on the 11th day of a 30-day billing period, and that user remains registered for the remainder of the billing period.

The prorated subscription cost for this user is determined by multiplying the monthly amount ($10 USD) by the number of days they are actively registered in the billing period (20) and dividing by the number of days in the month (30).

The prorated subscription cost for the user added on day 11 is $6.67 USD.

Similarly, if you make a registered user inactive in the middle of a billing cycle, we'll calculate the prorated amount using the formula above to determine the prorated charge.

Payment information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost uses a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to safely collect and store your credit card information. 

Credit cards are the only form of payment for customers on a monthly billing cycle. All major credit cards are accepted. You can only store information for one credit card in your account.

We offer pricing and billing only in U.S. Dollars (USD) at this time. Payment will be made in USD converted using the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

Sales tax and VAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost reserves the right to assess applicable taxes as required by local law. Depending on location, you may be charged transaction taxes when purchasing our product. Prices on our website are exclusive of sales tax or VAT.

Failed or late payments
-----------------------

You'll be notified immediately of failed payments both in-product, with a banner, and via email. The notifications provide directions on how to update payment information. Once payment information is updated, you'll be charged right away for the amount owing from the previous billing period.

If you have not paid or resolved the failed payment after 90 days, your workspace will be downgraded to Mattermost Free and subject to the data limits of that plan. If there is no activity on your workspace 60 days after the downgrade, your workspace will be deleted.

Add more users to your subscription
-----------------------------------

If you're on a monthly Cloud subscription, you can add more users to your instance which will be reflected on your monthly invoice. If you add new users in the middle of a billing cycle, you’ll only be charged for the days that the user is registered.

When you subscribe to an annual plan with Mattermost, you may incur retroactive charges on a quarterly basis for the actual number of registered users within your system if you are above the amount you subscribed in your purchase order. A registered user is a user who has an account in a workspace and does not show as *Inactive* in **System Console > User Management > Users**.

If you have more total active users than the number purchased in your annual subscription, we'll provide you with an invoice and an amendment to your purchase order for the new users added. The additional invoice will be pro-rated based on the number of months left in your subscription term, including the months for the calendar quarter at the time we review your user counts. We will not provide downward adjustments. Mattermost will invoice based on Mattermost’s `current list prices <https://mattermost.com/pricing/>`__.

Renew your subscription
-----------------------

Monthly Cloud subscriptions renew automatically.

Frequently asked questions
---------------------------

What happens when my 30-day Mattermost Enterprise trial period ends?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of the 30-day trial, you can opt to purchase a monthly subscription to Mattermost Professional via the prompts provided in Mattermost. 

If you choose not to continue, your subscription will revert to Mattermost Free and you will not be billed. In this case, Mattermost Enterprise features will no longer be available to use. Any data you may have that exceeds the `data limits </onboard/mattermost-limits.html>`_ for Mattermost Free will be auto-archived.

How am I billed for my Cloud monthly subscription?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your first Cloud subscription charge is at the end of the calendar month, and all monthly charges are billed in arrears on the first day of each month, e.g., June billing will be done on 7/1 for the period 6/1 - 6/30. 

After your first month, the billing period begins at 12 AM UTC on the first day of each calendar month and ends at 11:59 PM UTC on the final day of the same calendar month. Per-user pricing for each billing period will be based on the number of registered users.

- If you begin your subscription in the middle of a billing period, charges will be prorated. For example, if you signed up 6/15, we'll charge you on 7/1 for the period 6/15 - 6/30.
- Similarly, if you end your subscription in the middle of a billing period, charges will be prorated. For example, if you cancel your account on 6/15, we'll charge you on 7/1 for the period 6/1 - 6/15.
- If you upgrade in the middle of a billing period, charges will also be prorated. For example, if you upgrade from Professional to Enterprise on 6/15, we'll charge you 7/1. This will be a single charge for Professional for the period 6/1 - 6/14, then a separate charge for Enterprise for the period 6/15 - 6/30.

What happens if I decide to buy a subscription to Mattermost Enterprise during my trial?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your plan immediately changes to the plan you've upgraded to. Your trial will continue and on day 31 billing will commence. You won't incur any charges of your new plan until the trial period is over. Depending on what day of the month this is, you'll be billed prorata. You'll receive your bill at the end of the calendar month for this month and going forward.

How do I change my subscription to Cloud Free?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're on the Cloud Enterprise plan and want to move to another plan, please contact your Customer Success Manager or our `Support team <mailto:support@mattermost.com>`_.

If you're on Cloud Professional and want to move to Cloud Free:

1. Open **System Console > Billing & Account > Subscription**.
2. Select **View Plans**.
3. Select **Downgrade**.

Can I buy an annual Mattermost Cloud subscription?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Contact sales@mattermost.com to learn more about annual Cloud subscription options.

If you upgrade during a monthly billing cycle, charges will be prorated. For example, if you upgrade from monthly Professional to an annual term of Mattermost Enterprise on 6/15, we'll charge you on 7/1 for Professional for the period 6/1 - 6/14. A separate invoice will be provided for the annual Mattermost Enterprise subscription period starting 6/15.

How do I cancel my subscription? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To cancel your subscription, please `contact us <https://customers.mattermost.com/cloud/contact-us>`__.

I'm no longer being billed for my Cloud Starter ($149/year) plan. Why is that?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you created a Cloud Starter ($149/year) plan prior to June 15, 2022, your plan is now free with no data limits and is called Cloud Free. You have the option to `upgrade to Professional or Enterprise <https://mattermost.com/pricing/>`__, or continue using Cloud Free.

Cloud Free workspaces created on or after June 15, 2022 are free forever with certain `workspace limits </onboard/mattermost-limits.html#workspace-limits>`__ such as message and file history.

When will support for other regions be available?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise will support data residency based on feedback from our customers.

If you require your data to reside in an area outside of the United States, please contact the product team via `feedback-cloud@mattermost.com <feedback-cloud@mattermost.com>`_, or consider `deploying one of our Self-Hosted options <https://mattermost.com/deploy>`_ that provides full control of your data. You may also work with `one of our European partners <https://mattermost.com/partners>`_ for deploying and hosting your Mattermost server.

How is Mattermost Cloud secured?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud has encryption at-rest and in-transit. We're SOC2 Type 1 certified and working towards SOC2 Type 2.

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise is available to be deployed in a secure, private environment within a dedicated cloud offering to a single customer. This architecture provides the isolation and security of an on-premises deployment while ensuring consistent performance and uptime of your Mattermost workspace. `Please contact Mattermost Sales for more information on this option <https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/>`_.

What are the alternatives, and why should I choose Mattermost Cloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other SaaS offerings are closed-source and focus on a very broad use case. Mattermost Cloud is built on our open source core offering, allowing customers to view our source code and have a high degree of transparency into Mattermost development processes. Mattermost provides a DevOps-centric offering and has deep integrations and workflows that help builders and operators be more effective.

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise is available to be deployed in a private environment within an AWS VPC dedicated to a single customer. Other SaaS offerings are multi-tenant, meaning customers share resources. Please contact sales for more inforamtion on this option.

Is Mattermost Cloud Enterprise a dedicated instance run on AWS systems?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise can be deployed as a dedicated Mattermost environment running with separate infrastructure for your requirements (e.g., separate database, separate VMs, separate Kubernetes cluster). Please contact Mattermost Sales for more information on this option.

How is customer data in Mattermost Cloud Enterprise encrypted?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost uses AWS-provided functionality to enable encryption-at-rest for both databases and file stores. See `Encrypting Amazon RDS resources - Amazon Relational Database Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html>`__ and `Protecting data using server-side encryption - Amazon Simple Storage Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ for details.

Whether customer data should be stored in Mattermost Cloud depends heavily on the nature of the data and compliance requirements. We recommend that customers set up their own internal policies or controls around what can and cannot be put into Mattermost.

Are S3-managed keys used for server-side encryption? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Customer-provided keys may be considered for a future release. 

Do you provide cross-region failover in the event of an outage in AWS us-east-1 region?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud is hosted in AWS `us-east-1` region. Cross-region failover is planned, but not yet in the roadmap. If you have feedback or require cross-region failover, please reach out to our product team via feedback-cloud[at]mattermost.com.

What environments and rings are Cloud offerings deployed with?
