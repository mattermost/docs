Cloud subscriptions
===================

From 2 February 2023, Mattermost Cloud subscriptions are switching from a monthly subscription to an annual subscription. However, existing Cloud Professional monthly customers can maintain their monthly subscription.

Buy a Cloud subscription
------------------------

Mattermost Cloud can be used free forever with Mattermost Free.

You can also start a free, 30-day trial of Mattermost Enterprise to explore additional features. During or after the trial, you can choose to upgrade to Mattermost Professional in-product or Enterprise by `contacting sales <https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/>`__.

For Professional, follow the steps below:

1. Select **View Plans**.
2. Select Professional by clicking **Upgrade**.
3. Provide your credit card details.

.. note::
  
  Your credit card will be verified and you'll be charged immediately.
  
4. Click **Upgrade** to confirm.

If you choose not to upgrade at the end of your 30-day trial, your subscription will revert to Mattermost Free.

View subscription information
-----------------------------

The subscription screen outlines the details of your Mattermost Cloud account, including the annual cost per user and the number of users currently registered in your workspace. You can also find a summary of your last invoice in the same page, and any `workspace limits </onboard/mattermost-limits.html>`__ set for your subscription.

Billing period
--------------

After you begin your Mattermost Cloud paid subscription, your credit card is billed immediately. Your subscription automatically renews annually, however you can opt-out of auto-renewal.

If there's a payment failure, your invoice will show *Payment Failed*. Please review the accuracy of your credit card information in **Payment Information**. Unresolved failed payments may result in a delinquency and an interruption to your subscription.

Payment information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost uses a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to safely collect and store your credit card information. 

Credit cards are the only form of payment for customers on a monthly billing cycle. All major credit cards are accepted. You can only store information for one credit card in your account.

We offer pricing and billing only in U.S. Dollars (USD) at this time. Payment will be made in USD converted using the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

Sales tax and VAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost reserves the right to assess applicable taxes as required by local law. Depending on location, you may be charged transaction taxes when purchasing our product. Prices on our website are exclusive of sales tax or VAT.

Failed or late payments
-----------------------

You'll be notified immediately of failed payments both in-product, with a banner, and via email. The notifications provide directions on how to update payment information. Once payment information is updated, you'll be charged right away for the amount owing.

If you have not paid or resolved the failed payment after 90 days, your workspace will be downgraded to Mattermost Free and subject to the data limits of that plan. If there is no activity on your workspace 60 days after the downgrade, your workspace will be deleted.

Add more users to your Cloud Professional subscription
-----------------------------------

When you subscribe to an annual plan with Mattermost, you can add users to your workspace anytime. You may incur retroactive charges during renewal or at the end of your annual subscriptionon. You can view any upcoming charges in **System Console > Subscriptions**.

- If the number of users is less than 10% of initial number of users when you subscribed to your annual plan, you won't be billed for the cost of additional users retroactively
- If the number of users is greater than 10% of the initial number of users when you subscribed to your annual plan, you will be billed the cost of additional users, pro-rated during renewal or at the end of your annual subcsription.

Example:

- You subscribed to Cloud Professional on January 2023 for 100 users. Throughout your subscription term, you add 8 users. You will not be retroactively billed for the cost of additional users.
- You subscribed to Cloud Professional on January 2023 for 100 users. On March 2023, you add 5 users. On September 2023, you add another 10 users for a total of 15 users during your subscription term. You will be billed pro-rated for the cost of additional users incurred in March and September.


Renew your subscription
-----------------------

Monthly Cloud annual subscriptions renew automatically.

I'm no longer being billed for my Cloud Starter ($149/year) plan. Why is that?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you created a Cloud Starter ($149/year) plan prior to June 15, 2022, your plan is now free with no data limits and is called Cloud Free. You have the option to `upgrade to Professional or Enterprise <https://mattermost.com/pricing/>`__, or continue using Cloud Free.

Cloud Free workspaces created on or after June 15, 2022 are free forever with certain `workspace limits </onboard/mattermost-limits.html#workspace-limits>`__ such as message and file history.

When will support for other regions be available?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise will support data residency based on feedback from our customers.

If you require your data to reside in an area outside of the United States, please contact the product team via `feedback-cloud@mattermost.com <feedback-cloud@mattermost.com>`_, or consider `deploying one of our Self-Hosted options <https://mattermost.com/deploy>`_ that provides full control of your data. You may also work with `one of our European partners <https://mattermost.com/partners>`_ for deploying and hosting your Mattermost server.

How is Mattermost Cloud secured?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud has encryption at-rest and in-transit. We're SOC2 Type 1 certified and working towards SOC2 Type 2.

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise is available to be deployed in a secure, private environment within a dedicated cloud offering to a single customer. This architecture provides the isolation and security of an on-premises deployment while ensuring consistent performance and uptime of your Mattermost workspace. `Please contact Mattermost Sales for more information on this option <https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/>`_.

What are the alternatives, and why should I choose Mattermost Cloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other SaaS offerings are closed-source and focus on a very broad use case. Mattermost Cloud is built on our open source core offering, allowing customers to view our source code and have a high degree of transparency into Mattermost development processes. Mattermost provides a DevOps-centric offering and has deep integrations and workflows that help builders and operators be more effective.

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise is available to be deployed in a private environment within an AWS VPC dedicated to a single customer. Other SaaS offerings are multi-tenant, meaning customers share resources. Please contact sales for more inforamtion on this option.

Is Mattermost Cloud Enterprise a dedicated instance run on AWS systems?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise can be deployed as a dedicated Mattermost environment running with separate infrastructure for your requirements (e.g., separate database, separate VMs, separate Kubernetes cluster). Please contact Mattermost Sales for more information on this option.

How is customer data in Mattermost Cloud Enterprise encrypted?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost uses AWS-provided functionality to enable encryption-at-rest for both databases and file stores. See `Encrypting Amazon RDS resources - Amazon Relational Database Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html>`__ and `Protecting data using server-side encryption - Amazon Simple Storage Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ for details.

Whether customer data should be stored in Mattermost Cloud depends heavily on the nature of the data and compliance requirements. We recommend that customers set up their own internal policies or controls around what can and cannot be put into Mattermost.

Are S3-managed keys used for server-side encryption? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Customer-provided keys may be considered for a future release. 

Do you provide cross-region failover in the event of an outage in AWS us-east-1 region?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Cloud is hosted in AWS `us-east-1` region. Cross-region failover is planned, but not yet in the roadmap. If you have feedback or require cross-region failover, please reach out to our product team via feedback-cloud[at]mattermost.com.

What environments and rings are Cloud offerings deployed with?
