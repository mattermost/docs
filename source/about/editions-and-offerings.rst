Mattermost editions and plans 
=============================

Mattermost is an open core platform. 

This means we develop both an open source, self-hosted edition of our software provided free to our community, as well as a commercial edition that extends and enhances our open source software with paid, subscription-based offerings available both in self-hosted and cloud deployment modes.

You can choose between one of two compiled code bases, either open source (Team Edition) or commercial (Enterprise Edition).

We offer a range of plans, which are sets of features and entitlements available either free or as a paid subscription service. Mattermost sells subscriptions for both self-hosted and cloud deployments.

Self-hosted editions
--------------------

Self-hosted editions support deploying Mattermost within IT-controlled private environments in public clouds, including AWS, Azure, GCP and Oracle Cloud, as well as on-premises in private clouds and virtual or physical servers. When you're using a self-hosted deployment, a license file is provided and needs to be uploaded to activate your subscription.

Mattermost Team Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Team Edition is a free-to-use, open source, self-hosted collaboration platform offering all the core productivity benefits of competing SaaS solutions. It deploys as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL under an MIT license.

Mattermost Team Edition is also bundled inside of the free Mattermost Enterprise Edition code base, which provides the same functionality as Mattermost Team Edition, with the additional benefit of being able to trial as well as upgrade into an expanded set of features available with paid subscription, including Mattermost Professional and Mattermost Enterprise. 

Because of the benefits of Mattermost Enterprise Edition, we recommend installing it instead of Mattermost Team Edition, even if you don’t currently need a subscription, so you'll have the flexibility to trial or enable additional features should you need them. However, if you only want to install software with a fully open source license, then Mattermost Team Edition is the best choice.

Mattermost Enterprise Edition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our commercial, self-hosted software is called Mattermost Enterprise Edition, and it's available as a Linux binary that deploys identically to our open source version - including upgrading in an identical fashion - with two key differences: It contains code for advanced commercial features and it's offered under a commercial license (https://mattermost.com/enterprise-edition-license/). The commercial license prohibits reverse engineering and tampering with our license key mechanism unlocking paid features so that we can run a compliant and fair commercial business.

Once you’ve downloaded and installed Mattermost Enterprise Edition within your preferred environment, you have the option to use it as-is in a "free" mode, or you can access Mattermost's commercial features by starting a trial or by purchasing a subscription. You can start a 30-day free Enterprise trial via **System Console > Edition and License > Start trial**, or request a trial online at https://mattermost.com/trial/.

Mattermost plans
----------------

Mattermost plans consist of features and entitlements available either free or as a paid subscription service. 

We have three primary plans available to our self-hosted and cloud users: 

* **Mattermost Starter** - This a free version of our collaboration suite designed for single teams.
* **Mattermost Professional** - This is a paid subscription service providing advance access controls and user management for managers leading teams of teams.
* **Mattermost Enterprise** - This is a paid subscription service for large and sophisticated enterprise-scale deployments of the Mattermost suite.

For customers using our service in a self-hosted deployment, the Mattermost Starter offering is available in both our open source and commercial code bases (called Mattermost Team Edition and Mattermost Enterprise Edition, respectively). 

The Mattermost Professional and Mattermost Enterprise editions are only available after deploying our Mattermost Enterprise Edition code base, and then applying a valid license key that comes with a subscription purchase, or by starting a 30-day free trial that can be activated either in-product (**System Console > Edition and License > Start trial**) or online at https://mattermost.com/trial/.

Product decisions
-----------------

As the platform matures and new features are added, they're evaluated to be included in the plan that best aligns with the organizational use cases outlined by the editions above. Multiple factors are considered in determining the appropriate plan to include a feature including mission-critical impact, relative value to a single team, cross-functional teams, and the enterprise, as well as security, compliance, and scalability.

We recognize there aren't any features that are only useful to managers, directors, and executives. Individual practitioners may want certain features; however, we think that other buyers are relatively more likely to care about it. We also recognize that there may be some features that are put into an edition to find later there is much demand for it by individuals or a singular team; we will not hesitate to move that feature. We value feedback from our community and iterate based on that feedback. Simultaneously, we also need to offer commercial products that hold value and do our best to find the right balance. We believe the more of Mattermost that you use, the more likely it is that you benefit from the advanced editions we offer.

You can provide us with feedback via `our forum <https://mattermost.uservoice.com/>`__, where ideas and input influences the future of the platform.
