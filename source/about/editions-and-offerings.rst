Editions and Offerings 
======================

Mattermost is an open core platform. 

This means we develop both an open source, self-hosted edition of our software provided free to our community, as well as a commercial edition that extends and enhances our open source software with paid, subscription-based offerings available both in self-hosted and cloud deployment modes.

You can choose between one of two compiled code bases, either open source (`Team Edition <#mattermost-team-edition>`__) or commercial (`Enterprise Edition <#mattermost-enterprise-edition>`__).

We offer a range of `plans <#mattermost-plans>`__, which are sets of features and entitlements available either free or as a paid subscription service. Mattermost sells subscriptions for both self-hosted and cloud deployments.

Self-hosted editions
--------------------

Self-hosted editions support deploying Mattermost within IT-controlled private environments in public clouds, including AWS, Azure, GCP and Oracle Cloud, as well as on-premises in private clouds and virtual or physical servers. When you're using a self-hosted deployment, a license file is provided and needs to be uploaded to activate your subscription.

For customers using our service in a self-hosted deployment, the `Mattermost Free <#mattermost-free>`__ offering is available in both our open source and commercial code bases (called `Mattermost Team Edition <#mattermost-team-edition>`__ and `Mattermost Enterprise Edition <#mattermost-enterprise-edition>`__, respectively). 

Mattermost Enterprise Edition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our commercial, self-hosted software is called Mattermost Enterprise Edition, and it's available as a Linux binary that deploys identically to our open source version - including upgrading in an identical fashion - with two key differences: It contains code for advanced commercial features and it's offered under a commercial license (https://mattermost.com/enterprise-edition-license/). The commercial license prohibits reverse engineering and tampering with our license key mechanism unlocking paid features so that we can run a compliant and fair commercial business.

Once you’ve downloaded and installed Mattermost Enterprise Edition within your preferred environment, you have the option to use it as-is in a "free" mode, or you can access Mattermost's commercial features by starting a trial or by purchasing a subscription. You can start a 30-day free Enterprise trial via **System Console > Edition and License > Start trial**, or request a trial online at https://mattermost.com/trial/.

Mattermost Team Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Team Edition is a free-to-use, open source, self-hosted collaboration platform offering all the core productivity benefits of competing SaaS solutions. It deploys as a single Linux binary with PostgreSQL under an MIT license.

Mattermost Team Edition is also bundled inside of the free Mattermost Enterprise Edition code base, which provides the same functionality as Mattermost Team Edition, with the additional benefit of being able to trial as well as upgrade into an expanded set of features available with paid subscription, including Mattermost Professional and Mattermost Enterprise. 

Because of the benefits of Mattermost Enterprise Edition, we recommend installing it instead of Mattermost Team Edition, even if you don’t currently need a subscription, so you'll have the flexibility to trial or enable additional features should you need them. However, if you only want to install software with a fully open source license, then Mattermost Team Edition is the best choice.

Mattermost plans
----------------

Mattermost plans consist of features and entitlements available either a paid subscription service or free. 

The Mattermost Professional, Enterprise, or Enterprise Advanced editions are only available after deploying our Mattermost Enterprise Edition binary, and then applying a valid license key that comes with a subscription purchase. Alternatively, you can start a 30-day free trial that can be activated either in-product (**System Console > Edition and License > Start trial**) or online at https://mattermost.com/trial/.

**Core search**: Search over messages and files in Mattermost. Core search happens in a relational database and is intended for deployments under about 2–3 million posts and file entries.

**Delegated granular administration**: In large deployments where administrative tasks need to be separated and delegated, Mattermost supports the [creation and customization of system administrator roles with specific granular permissions](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/delegated-granular-administration.html) in order to offer specialized administration delegated from senior administrators.

**Data retention policy**: Meet data retention compliance requirements. By default Mattermost uses a “soft delete” system where messages and files deleted based on user actions are removed from the user interface, but persist in the Mattermost database. By activating [Mattermost’s data retention policy capability](https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/data-retention-policy.html), rules can be set to permanently delete all messages and files in a Mattermost system, or in specific teams or channels, that are beyond a specific age (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, or other options). This feature should be used carefully; once data is removed using data retention policies, the action is irreversible.

**Legal hold**: Comply with legal hold and litigation hold requests to preserve information in anticipation of legal action. The [legal hold capability](https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/legal-hold.html) can be combined with eDiscovery integration and data retention policies to customize the data retained and deleted to meet compliance requirements.

**Private mobility with ID-only push notifications**: This capability protects a Mattermost customer against breaches in iOS and Android notification infrastructure by enabling mobile notifications to be fully private. The standard way to send notifications to iOS and Android applications requires sending clear text messages to Apple or Google so they can be forwarded to a user’s phone and displayed on iOS or Android. While Apple and Google assure the data is not collected or stored, all standard mobile notifications on the platform could be compromised should the organizations be breached or coerced. To avoid this risk, Mattermost can be configured to replace mobile notification text with message ID numbers that pass no information to Apple of Google, and which, when received by the Mattermost mobile application on a user’s phone, are used to privately communicate with their Mattermost server and use the message ID to retrieve mobile notification messages over an encrypted channel. This means at no time will the message text be visible to Apple or Google’s message relay system. Because of the extra steps to retrieve the notifications messages under Mattermost’s private mobility capability with ID-only push notifications, end users may experience a slight delay before the mobile notification is fully displayed compared to sending clear text through Apple and Google’s platform.

**Workflow automation**:
**Streamline and automate workflows to reduce errors and delays while increasing efficiency and innovation using collaborative playbooks to speed structured team processes, from incident response and software release cycle management to accelerating operational logistics, as well as workflow dashboards to assess and refine process outcomes and operations.**:
**Collaborative playbooks**: [Collaborative playbooks](https://docs.mattermost.com/repeatable-processes/learn-about-playbooks.html) provide structure, monitoring and automation for repeatable, team-based processes integrated with the Mattermost platform. Use cases include incident response, software release management, and logistical operations. Playbooks monitor channels for keywords or user actions to trigger structured processes, which bring up a set of individual or shared tasks, each associated with manual or automated actions. As playbooks execute, some may have requirements for broadcasting status updates to stakeholders at regular intervals, conducting retrospectives after the core process is complete, or meeting other customer needs as exit criteria for each playbook “run.” Advanced permissions are also available to delegate and manage playbook controls in larger organizations.

**Workflow dashboards**: [Workflow dashboards](https://docs.mattermost.com/repeatable-processes/metrics-and-goals.html) unlock insights about the performance of collaborative workflows across organizations. They compare the output metrics from different runs of collaborative playbooks against targets and historical performance. Examples of metrics-based workflow dashboards that can be set up to monitor and inform performance include time to detect and time to resolve in incident response workflows, workplan completion percentage for monthly software releases management workflows, and launch success rate for logistical workflows involving launch operations.

Product decisions
-----------------

As the platform matures and new features are added, they're evaluated to be included in the plan that best aligns with the organizational use cases outlined by the editions above. Multiple factors are considered in determining the appropriate plan to include a feature including mission-critical impact, relative value to a single team, cross-functional teams, and the enterprise, as well as security, compliance, and scalability.

We recognize there aren't any features that are only useful to managers, directors, and executives. Individual practitioners may want certain features; however, we think that other buyers are relatively more likely to care about it. We also recognize that there may be some features that are put into an edition to find later there is much demand for it by individuals or a singular team; we will not hesitate to move that feature. We value feedback from our community and iterate based on that feedback. Simultaneously, we also need to offer commercial products that hold value and do our best to find the right balance. We believe the more of Mattermost that you use, the more likely it is that you benefit from the advanced editions we offer.

You can provide us with feedback via `our idea portal <https://portal.productboard.com/mattermost/33-what-matters-to-you>`_, where ideas and input influences the future of the platform.
