On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement
===========================================
With Skype for Business reaching end-of-life, security-conscious organizations face a critical inflection point. Many operate in air-gapped or classified environments where cloud-based alternatives are not viable due to compliance restrictions, risk exposure, or data sovereignty mandates. Without a secure, modern, on-premises collaboration platform, these organizations risk operational disruption, mission misalignment, and non-compliance with stringent regulatory frameworks.

Mattermost provides a secure, self-hosted communication and collaboration platform purpose-built for air-gapped environments, classified networks, and regulated industries. Designed to meet NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, and DISA STIG compliance requirements, Mattermost replaces legacy tools with modern capabilities—secure messaging, file sharing, workflow automation, and integrated video collaboration—while maintaining full enterprise control. Organizations can operate at scale, enable external collaboration without policy violations, and modernize their digital workflows without compromising security.

The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available: 

Air-Gapped and Classified Operations
------------------------------------

Organizations operating in fully disconnected or classified environments require secure communication platforms that function entirely within their own infrastructure.

**Benefits**

- **Ensure secure communication in fully disconnected networks** using Mattermost’s support for private on-premise deployments, including FIPS 140-2 validated and DISA STIG-hardened container images. :doc:`Learn more </deploy/application-architecture>` about Mattermost’s architecture, components, and backend infrastructure.
- **Maintain operational continuity** with enterprise-grade :doc:`channel-based collaboration </guides/collaborate>`—including :doc:`1:1 audio calls </collaborate/make-calls>`, :ref:`screen sharing <collaborate/make-calls:share your screen>`, :doc:`threaded messaging </collaborate/organize-conversations>`, and :doc:`file sharing </collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`—entirely within air-gapped systems.
- **Scale to mission requirements** with a :doc:`high-availability, horizontally scalable architecture </scale/scaling-for-enterprise>` that supports tens of thousands of users in secure on-prem environments.
- **Preserve data sovereignty and eliminate external dependencies** with a self-hosted :doc:`Kubernetes deployment model </deploy/server/deploy-kubernetes>` that integrates into classified networks or sovereign data centers.

Modernize Secure Collaboration Workflows
------------------------------------------

Legacy communication tools lack the flexibility, automation, and usability demanded by modern operational teams. Mattermost introduces modern collaboration workflows without compromising compliance or deployment control.

**Benefits**

- **Enable dynamic, cross-platform messaging and coordination** with a unified interface across web, desktop, and mobile—featuring :doc:`threaded discussions </collaborate/organize-conversations>`, :ref:`file previews <collaborate/share-files-in-messages:preview file attachments>`, and :ref:`screen sharing <collaborate/make-calls:share your screen>`.
- **Streamline mission-critical processes** with :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </guides/repeatable-processes>` that automate and track workflows like incident response, shift turnover, and logistics planning.
- **Embed secure video conferencing into daily operations** using the `Pexip integration <https://mattermost.com/marketplace/pexip-video-connect/>`_, allowing real-time video engagement from within your air-gapped or secure infrastructure.
- **Support operational task management** through optional Kanban-style `Boards <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-boards>`_ for structured, accountable planning—hosted securely within your own network.
- **Align the user experience with your operational identity** using :doc:`custom branding </configure/custom-branding-tools>`, :doc:`theming </preferences/customize-your-theme>`, and :ref:`product localization <preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>` across more than 20 languages to support multinational teams.

Enterprise-Controlled External Collaboration
--------------------------------------------

Collaborating across organizational boundaries must not compromise compliance or IT governance. Mattermost enables secure external engagement while keeping control centralized within the enterprise.

- **Apply fine-grained access controls and retention policies** to external users through enterprise-managed :doc:`permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions>`, :ref:`audit logging <manage/logging:audit logging>`, and :ref:`channel-specific configurations <manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`.
- **Integrate with Microsoft Teams, Exchange, and M365** to maintain centralized workflows and extend secure communication to external stakeholders without leaving policy-aligned platforms. See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Manage user identity and access** across internal and external roles using Microsoft :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>` (Azure AD) synchronization for scalable and compliant provisioning.
