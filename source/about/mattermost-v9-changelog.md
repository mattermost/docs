# v9 changelog

```{Important}
Support for Mattermost Server v9.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) is coming to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2024. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v9.11 or later is recommended.
- Upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` -> ``major_next``) is fully supported and tested. However, upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` to ``major+2``) is supported, but not tested. If you plan to upgrade across multiple releases, we strongly recommend upgrading from an ESR to another ESR. For example, if you're upgrading from the v8.1 ESR, upgrade to the [v9.5 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/mattermost-v9-changelog.html#release-v9-5-extended-support-release) or the v9.11 ESR.
- See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) documentation for details on upgrading to a newer release.
- See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for details about the upcoming release.

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - Added support for Elasticsearch v8. Also added Beta support for Opensearch. A new config setting ``ElasticsearchSettings.Backend`` has been added to differentiate between Elasticsearch and Opensearch. The default value is Elasticsearch. Note that this will break support for AWS Elasticsearch v7.10.x. The official v8 client only works from Elasticsearch v7.11 and higher versions. Customers using AWS Elasticsearch are requested to upgrade to AWS Opensearch for future compatibility. Upgrade steps can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html.
     - Note: The value cannot be dynamically changed from the System Console while the server is running. One needs to shut down the server, manually edit the config, and then restart the server when switching from one backend to another, and either use mmctl or edit the config manually.
     - If you are using Opensearch, you **must** set the backend to opensearch. Otherwise Mattermost will not work. 
     - If you are using Elasticsearch v8, be sure to set ``action.destructive_requires_name`` to ``false`` in ``elasticsearch.yml`` to allow for wildcard operations to work.
     - For AWS customers on Opensearch, do not enable "compatibility mode".

### Compatibility
 - Updated minimum Edge and Chrome versions to 126+.
 - Added Ubuntu Noble support.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v9.5, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Improvements

See [this walkthrough video](https://mattermost.com/video/video-mattermost-v9-9-changelog/) on some of the improvements in our latest release below.

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin version [v0.27.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v0.27.0).
 - Pre-packaged Jira plugin version [v4.1.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases/tag/v4.1.1).
 - Pre-packaged GitLab plugin version [v1.9.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab/releases/tag/v1.9.0).
 - Pre-packaged Zoom plugin version [v1.8.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom/releases/tag/v1.8.0).
 - Updated the default themes to reduce eye strain (particularly on the dark themes).
 - Added UI improvements to the core layout.
 - Improved error text when inviting guests to a team.
 - Increased the visibility Mattermost edition in-product when using the free edition.
 - Added an **Unsupported** label to the Team/E0 editions in the product menu.
 - Improved the look and feel of the **True/False** selector in the System Console.
 - Updated the channel header layout to reduce height and simplify the UI.

#### Administration
 - Removed safety limit error message in compiled Team Edition and unlicensed Enterprise Edition deployments when message count exceeds 5 million posts.
 - Adjusted safety limit error message to show when users exceed 5,000 in compiled Team Edition and Enterprise Edition deployments when enterprise scale and access control automation features are unavailable. ``ERROR_SAFE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED``.
 - Improved the message length validation step in the ``mmctl import validate`` command.
 - Added shell completion to ``mmctl user active`` and ``mmctl user deactivate``.
 - Removed support for self-serve purchases of Mattermost Subscriptions in various flows, throughout Cloud and Self Hosted environments.
 - Removed support for self-serve true up review submission in the **System Console**. 
 - Added streaming support to the file attachments import process.
 - Added LDAP job command to mmctl.
 - Made LDAP sync jobs more resilient against errors.
 - Removed the ``PostPriority`` feature flag.
 - Improved the error message of ``NotFound`` errors in store.
 - Added support for post priority to incoming webhooks and outgoing webhook responses.
 - Added a validation that the payload for an open Interactive Dialog request is valid according to the rules at https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/plugins/interactive-dialogs/.
 - Unblocked notification calls by using usernames instead of full names in case of a missing user profile.
 - Increased the maximum password limit from 64 to 72 characters (``PasswordMaximumLength``).

#### Performance
 - Added the initial version of new client-side performance metrics to track web app performance and can be monitored in new [Grafana board](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21460-web-app-metrics/).
 - Added a metric to track time it takes for the right-hand side to load.
 - Improved js memory profile of status’s reducers.
 - When a user receives a new post that is part of a thread from a root post in a channel they are not currently viewing, we do not fetch the complete root post and its thread posts immediately. However, we still store the newly received post. The root post and its thread posts are only fetched when the user navigates to that specific channel.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with ``aria-label`` for sidebar channel buttons.
 - Fixed an issue where any remaining unclosed database RPC connections were not closed after a plugin shut down.

 - Fixed an issue where on some servers the user could not see the member count in the **Browse Channels** dialog.
 - Fixed an issue with inline display of WebP images accessed through the public-link feature.
 - Fixed an issue where it wasn’t clear that the ``mmctl import process --bypass-upload --local`` doesn't work if the server is in High Availability.
 - Fixed an issue where the user status would incorrectly be set to offline without checking for connections in other nodes in an High Availability cluster.
 - Fixed a longstanding issue where the @mention auto-complete could erase post text following the auto-completed @mention.
 - Fixed an issue with status management to avoid missing notifications.
 - Fixed an issue where audit events were not added for OAuth logins.
 - Fixed an issue with the error check in the message export process.
 - Fixed an issue where pasting in the post text box could not always paste without formatting.
 - Fixed some plugin settings with defaults not changing value.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``ExperimentalSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``DisableWakeUpReconnectHandler`` to disable the wake up on reconnect handler.
 - Removed ``SelfHostedPurchase`` setting.

#### Changes to the Enterprise plan: 
 - Under ``MetricsSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added a feature flag and a setting ``EnableClientMetrics`` to control new client performance metrics.
    - Added a setting for notification metrics ``EnableNotificationMetrics``.
 - Self-hosted system administrators can now configure all ``ExperimentalAuditSettings`` through the user interface in the ``System Console``. Cloud administrators can now change the ``AdvancedLoggingJSON`` value for the ``ExperimentalAuditSettings``. This is the only configuration that Cloud administrators are able to adjust. Feature flag ``ExperimentalAuditSettingsSystemConsoleUI`` must be enabled in order to leverage this new user interface.

### Websocket Event Changes
 - Changed the semantics of the ``mattermost_http_websockets_total`` metric to track all open WebSocket connections, regardless of whether they are authenticated.

### Known Issues
 - Some Cloud workspaces unexpectedly received emails about license expiration.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.

#### Changes to all plans:

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - We have stopped supporting MySQL v5.7 since it's at the end of life. We urge customers to upgrade their MySQL instance at their earliest convenience.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v9.4, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Improvements

See [this walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1M2BGGF578&feature=youtu.be) on some of the improvements in our latest release below.

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls version [v0.23.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v0.23.1).
 - Pre-packaged Jira plugin version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases/tag/v4.1.0).
 - Improved the behavior of suggestion boxes when changing the caret position.
 - Changed the time for tomorrow in the **Do Not Disturb** timer and post reminder to refer to the next day at 9:00am instead of 24hrs from the time of activation.
 - Updated message timestamp tooltips to include seconds.
 - Added a new Wrangler feature to be able to move threads (Experimental). Moving threads requires a Professional/Enterprise license to activate. This feature is not yet recommended for production use. A new feature flag ``MoveThreadsEnabled`` was added and is default OFF. Changing this value to ON will enable the experimental **Move Threads** feature.
 - Applied a wording change for active and activated users in the **System Console** user list.
 - Applied a wording change for active and activated users in the **Team Statistics** page.

#### Administration
 - Added safety limit error message in compiled Team Edition and Enterprise Edition deployments when enterprise scale and access control automation features are unavailable and count of users who are registered and not deactivated exceeds 10,000. ERROR_SAFE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED.
 - The ``where`` field is now rendered in ``model.AppError`` only when it's present.
 - Added Outgoing Oauth implementation ``Get``/``List`` logic.
 - The mmctl bulk import process command in local mode now supports processing an import file without actually uploading it to the server. Simply pass the file path to the import file and the server will directly read from it, and pass the ``--bypass-upload`` flag. There is no need to use the import upload command. NOTE: all of this is applicable only in local mode.
 - Added **Monthly Active Users** (MAU) as part of the true-up report.
 - Prometheus metrics are now available under the Source Available License.

#### Performance
 - Optimized ``createPost`` performance.
 - Improved the performance of emoji uploads.
 - Made small optimizations in several database calls:
     - ``App.HasPermissionToChannel``
     - ``getPostsForChannelAroundLastUnread``
     - ``publishWebsocketEventForPermalinkPost``
     - ``countMentionsFromPost``

#### Plugins
 - Plugins are now allowed to register user settings.
 - Plugins can now register an action in the **User Settings** section. Plugins can also now disable a section in their **User Settings**.
 - Included session id in request payload of the ``WebSocketMessageHasBeenPosted`` plugin hook.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the right-hand side stopped getting the focus when navigating from **Global Threads** or **Global Drafts**.
 - Fixed a theme issue in the notification settings.
 - Fixed a regression in compliance exports which did not allow the export job to be canceled gracefully on server shutdown.
 - Fixed an error where posts dismissed by a plugin were not properly removed from the view.
 - Fixed an issue where if there were multiple websocket connections from a single user, then in case one connection got removed during a broadcast, there was a possibility that the other good connection would not get the event.
 - Fixed an issue with true-up reports sending active users and not activated users.
 - Fixed an issue where users were not able to navigate through links to private channels they are member of with certain configurations.

### config.json
 - Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added ``MaximumPayloadSizeBytes`` to add a limit to the payload size of API endpoints passing in arrays.
 - Added a configuration setting ``OutgoingIntegrationRequestsDefaultTimeout`` for integration requests.

#### Changes to the Professional and Enterprise plans:
 - Under ``WranglerSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``AllowedEmailDomain`` - a CSV list of strings, where each is an email domain that is allowed to use the feature (e.g. - on community.mattermost.com, ``mattermost.com`` would allow staff to move a thread, while non-staff cannot).
    - ``MoveThreadMaxCount`` - a number representing the maximum number of posts that can be in a thread for it to be moveable.
    - ``MoveThreadToAnotherTeamEnable`` - a boolean value representing whether moving should work across teams.
    - ``MoveThreadFromPrivateChannelEnable`` - a boolean value representing whether moving should work from within a private channel.
    - ``MoveThreadFromDirectMessageChannelEnable`` - a boolean value representing whether moving should be allowed from within a group message.

#### Changes to the Enterprise plan:
 - Under ``DataRetentionSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added two new configuration settings, ``MessageRetentionHours`` and ``FileRetentionHours``, in order to support setting your global retention time in hours. ``DataRetentionSettings.MessageRetentionDays`` and ``DataRetentionSettings.FileRetentionDays`` are deprecated but we will continue to use their value until you set something for their hours equivalent. If Days are set then the hours configuration must be 0 and if hours is set then the days config must be 0. We do not support hours for granular retention policies. Due to how our Elasticsearch indexes are stored, Data retention will now also remove elastic search indexes equal to the day of the retention cut-off time.

### API Changes
 - Added a new API endpoint ``POST /api/v4/posts/<post ID>/move``.
 - Added ``UpdateChannelMembersNotifications`` plugin API.
 - Added plugin APIs and hooks for accessing the **Shared Channels** service via plugins.
 - Added a limit to the payload size of API endpoints passing in arrays.
 - Added ``PreferencesHaveChanged`` plugin hook.
 - Added ``GetPreferenceForUser`` plugin API.
 - Added a new API endpoint ``GET /api/v4/users/report`` for system admin user reporting.
 - Added a new API endpoint ``GET /api/v4/reports/users/count``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``@tanstack/react-table`` and ``prometheus/client_model`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/.

### Go Version
 - v9.5 is built with Go ``v1.20.7``.

### Known Issues
 - User autocomplete no longer stays closed after pressing ESC key [MM-56748](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-56748).
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Fixed data retention policies to run jobs when any custom retention policy is enabled even when the global retention policy is set to **keep-forever**. Before this fix, the enabled custom data retention policies wouldn’t run as long as the global data retention policy was set to **keep-forever** or was disabled. After the fix, the custom data retention policies will run automatically even when the global data retention policy is set to **keep-forever**. Once the server is upgraded, posts may unintentionally be deleted. Admins should make sure to disable all custom data retention policies before upgrading, and then re-enable them again after upgrading.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v9.1, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Compatibility

 - Improved readability by displaying system messages on multiple lines when editing a channel header.
 - Combined "joined/left" event types in system messages.
 - Added a new user preference to disable webapp prefetching via **Settings > Advanced > Allow Mattermost to prefetch channel posts**. You must enable **Client Performance Debugging** in the System Console by going to **Environment > Developer** in order for this setting to appear. This setting and Client Performance Debugging should only be enabled temporarily if users are experiencing performance issues.
 - Pre-packaged NPS plugin version [v1.3.3](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-nps/releases/tag/v1.3.3).
 - Pre-packaged Todo plugin version [v0.7.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-todo/releases/tag/v0.7.1).

#### Administration
 - JSON null value cases are now handled correctly by also checking that the pointer is no longer null when unmarshalling to a pointer.
 - An annotated logger is now used to capture LDAP and SAML logs.

 - Improved performance on data retention ``DeleteOrphanedRows`` queries.

Removed feature flag ``DataRetentionConcurrencyEnabled``. Data retention now runs without concurrency in order to avoid any performance degradation. Added a new configuration setting ``DataRetentionSettings.RetentionIdsBatchSize``, which allows admins to to configure how many batches of IDs will be fetched at a time when deleting orphaned reactions. The default value is 100.
 - Minimum supported Desktop App version is now v5.3. OAuth/SAML flows were modified to include ``desktop_login`` which makes earlier versions incompatible.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v9.0, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Compatibility
 - Updated Chromium minimum supported version to 116+.

### Highlights

#### Never Miss Group Messages Again
 - Group messages (GMs) now behave like direct messages (DMs). [The badge count increases for every new message](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/channel-types.html#group-messages).

#### Convert Group Messages to Private Channels
 - Added the ability to [convert a group message to a private channel](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/convert-group-messages.html).

See [this walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbHg-63J9dA) on the highlights and some of the below improvements in our latest release.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)

### Go Version

### Known Issues
 - Converting a group message to a channel should show an error "A channel with that name already exists on the same team" for duplicate channel names [MM-54713](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-54713).
 - Marking a group message as unread doesn't resurface the numbered notification badge [MM-54778](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-54778).
 - Thread/posts jump when switching to and from preview mode [MM-54758](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-54758).
 - Desktop UI doesn't show all content when the right-hand side thread is opened [MM-54696](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-54696).
 - Left-hand side resize option overrides the **Browse/Create Channel** menu if To-Do plugin is installed [MM-54367](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-54367).
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
