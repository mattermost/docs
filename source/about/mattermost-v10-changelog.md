# v10 changelog

```{Important}
Support for Mattermost Server v9.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) is coming to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2024. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v9.11 or later is recommended.
- Upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` -> ``major_next``) is fully supported and tested. However, upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` to ``major+2``) is supported, but not tested. If you plan to upgrade across multiple releases, we strongly recommend upgrading from an ESR to another ESR. For example, if you're upgrading from the v8.1 ESR, upgrade to the [v9.5 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/mattermost-v9-changelog.html#release-v9-5-extended-support-release) or the v9.11 ESR.
- See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) documentation for details on upgrading to a newer release.
- See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for details about the upcoming release.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - We no longer support new installations using MySQL starting in v10. All new customers and/or deployments will only be supported with the minimum supported version of the PostgreSQL database. End of support for MySQL is targeted for Mattermost v11.
 - Apps Framework is deprecated for new installs. Please extend Mattermost using webhooks, slash commands, OAuth2 apps, and plugins.
 - Mattermost v10 introduces Playbooks v2 for all Enterprise licensed customers. Professional SKU customers may continue to use Playbooks v1 uninterrupted which will be maintained and supported until September 2025, followed by an appropriate grandfathering strategy. More detailed information and the discussion are available on the [Mattermost discussion forum](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/clarification-on-playbooks-in-mattermost-v10/20563).
 - Renamed ``Channel Moderation`` to ``Advanced Access Control`` in the channel management section in the **System Console**.
 - Renamed announcement banner feature to “system-wide notifications”.
 - Renamed “Collapsed Reply Threads” to “Threaded Discussions” in the System Console.
 - Renamed “System Roles” to “Delegated Granular Administration” in the System Console.
 - Renamed "Office 365" to "Entra ID" for SSO logins.
 - Fully deprecated the ``/api/v4/image`` endpoint when the image proxy is disabled.
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.0.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.0.1). This includes breaking changes including removal of group calls from unlicensed servers in order to focus supportability and quality on licensed servers. Unlicensed servers can continue to use Calls in direct message channels, which represent the majority of activity.
 - Removed deprecated ``Config.ProductSettings``, ``LdapSettings.Trace``, and ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` configuration fields.
 - Removed deprecated ``pageSize`` query parameter from most API endpoints.
 - Deprecated the experimental Strict CSRF token enforcement. This feature will be fully removed in Mattermost v11.
