# v10 changelog

```{Important}
Support for Mattermost Server v9.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) is coming to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2024. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v9.11 or later is recommended.
- Upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` -> ``major_next``) is fully supported and tested. However, upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` to ``major+2``) is supported, but not tested. If you plan to upgrade across multiple releases, we strongly recommend upgrading from an ESR to another ESR. For example, if you're upgrading from the v8.1 ESR, upgrade to the [v9.5 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/mattermost-v9-changelog.html#release-v9-5-extended-support-release) or the v9.11 ESR.
- See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) documentation for details on upgrading to a newer release.
- See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for details about the upcoming release.

(release-v10.0-major-release)=
## Release v10.0 - [Major Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/release-policy.html#release-types)

**Release day: 2024-09-16**

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - We no longer support new installations using MySQL starting in v10. All new customers and/or deployments will only be supported with the minimum supported version of the PostgreSQL database. End of support for MySQL is targeted for Mattermost v11.
 - Apps Framework is deprecated for new installs. Please extend Mattermost using webhooks, slash commands, OAuth2 apps, and plugins.
 - Mattermost v10 introduces Playbooks v2 for all Enterprise licensed customers. Professional SKU customers may continue to use Playbooks v1 uninterrupted which will be maintained and supported until September 2025, followed by an appropriate grandfathering strategy. More detailed information and the discussion are available on the [Mattermost discussion forum](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/clarification-on-playbooks-in-mattermost-v10/20563).
 - Renamed ``Channel Moderation`` to ``Advanced Access Control`` in the channel management section in the **System Console**.
 - Renamed announcement banner feature to “system-wide notifications”.
 - Renamed “Collapsed Reply Threads” to “Threaded Discussions” in the System Console.
 - Renamed “System Roles” to “Delegated Granular Administration” in the System Console.
 - Renamed "Office 365" to "Entra ID" for SSO logins.
 - Fully deprecated the ``/api/v4/image`` endpoint when the image proxy is disabled.
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.0.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.0.1). This includes breaking changes including removal of group calls from unlicensed servers in order to focus supportability and quality on licensed servers. Unlicensed servers can continue to use Calls in direct message channels, which represent the majority of activity.
 - Removed deprecated ``Config.ProductSettings``, ``LdapSettings.Trace``, and ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` configuration fields.
 - Removed deprecated ``pageSize`` query parameter from most API endpoints.
 - Deprecated the experimental Strict CSRF token enforcement. This feature will be fully removed in Mattermost v11.

 - Promoted GIF picker, custom groups and message priority out of Beta.
 - Removed the **Pre-release features** section from **Settings > Advanced** due to lack of usage.

#### Administration
 - Made payload size limit error more clearly visible and recognisable in API responses and server error logs.
 - Extended the plugin schema to support defining sections for **System Console** settings.
 - Added support for a default team on secure connections for incoming channel invites.
 - Remote clusters can now be created without explicitly providing a password.
 - Files are now fetched from all nodes in a cluster when generating a Support Packet.

#### Performance

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with web app notifications not being shown in the **Notification Center** on Windows or Mac.

 - Fixed an issue where false warnings about Channel indexes being incorrect were sent to system admins.

 - Fixed an issue where the **Edit Post Time Limit** button was not being displayed in the System Console.
 - Fixed another issue where users would not see channels they were added to/messages from those channels in clustered environments.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added a new setting ``MaximumURLLength`` to remove the hardcoded URL length limit.
 - Removed deprecated ``Config.ProductSettings``.
 - Removed ``EnablePreviewFeatures`` setting.

#### Changes to the Enterprise plan:
 - Removed deprecated ``LdapSettings.Trace`` setting.
 - Removed deprecated ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` setting.

### API Changes
 - Reduced the number of API requests made to fetch user information for Group Messages on page load.
 - User APIs now enforce username beginning with alphabetic character, matching client-side validation.
 - Added a new request parameter ``include_total_count`` to API endpoint ``GET /api/v4/hooks/incoming``.

### Go Version
 - v10.0 is built with Go ``v1.21.8``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``redis/rueidis`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.

### Known Issues
 - The cursor is not placed in the "Write to" field on login [MM-60275](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-60275).
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
