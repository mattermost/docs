Mattermost Server installs as a single compiled binary file that includes the RESTful JSON web service, authentication client, authentication provider, notification service, and data management service. The Mattermost Server can be deployed in stand-alone or high availability mode where two or more servers are clustered together using gossip protocol and a proxy server that routes traffic from client applications to healthy servers in the cluster.
