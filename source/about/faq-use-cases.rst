Use Case Questions
==================

Does Mattermost support external guests?
----------------------------------------

Yes, the Guest Account feature allows organizations to collaborate with external users within a controlled environment. See the `Guest Accounts documentation <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/guest-accounts.html>`__ for more information.

Can I use Mattermost for customer service?
-------------------------------------------

You are welcome to use the open source Mattermost Team Edition and its extensive API library to build your own solution.

Mattermost Enterprise Edition is designed for self-hosted, enterprise-grade communication. It's not recommended for primarily providing customer service or customer support, and does not currently offer a licensing model nor technical advice for this use case.

If you'd like to create an open source derivative version of Mattermost using the ``/mattermost-server`` source code to support your use case, please see below.

Does Mattermost have an official website-based plugin to offer anonymous chat to visitors?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not yet. You can `upvote the feature proposal online <https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general/suggestions/8810731-implement-a-site-chat-feature>`__ to add your support. If you create such a plugin, we would love to see it open sourced and made available to the community.
