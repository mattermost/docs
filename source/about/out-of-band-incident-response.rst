Out-of-Band Incident Response
=============================

When cyberattacks, infrastructure failures, or security breaches disrupt primary systems, organizations must maintain the ability to coordinate securely and act decisively. Traditional communication tools often become liabilities under these conditions—prone to compromise, unavailable during outages, or unable to support secure workflows. The operational and financial consequences of downtime can be catastrophic, underscoring the need for an independent collaboration environment.

Mattermost provides a secure, mission-resilient out-of-band (OOB) collaboration platform that operates outside your primary infrastructure. Whether deployed as a self-hosted Kubernetes instance or via Mattermost Cloud, the platform ensures real-time coordination remains available during network outages, security incidents, or critical decision windows. Built for security-conscious teams and regulated industries, Mattermost supports integrated incident workflows, and enterprise-level access control to enable business continuity—even under duress.

The following mission-critical OOB collaboration capabilities are available:

Always-Available Backup Communications
--------------------------------------

Out-of-band collaboration provides a persistent, independent channel for coordinating during crises—separate from compromised or degraded primary systems.

**Benefits**

- **Preserve communication during infrastructure failures** with secure, dedicated OOB deployments across private Kubernetes clusters or Azure Marketplace-hosted environments. :ref:`Explore deployment options <deploy/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`.
- **Safeguard sensitive communications** with FIPS 140-2 validated and STIG-hardened images, ensuring secure operation in classified or regulated environments.
- **Maintain continuity across platforms** with :doc:`multi-device access </guides/deployment-guide>`—including web, desktop, and mobile experiences—even when primary tools are offline.
- **Enforce strict access controls** using :doc:`role-based permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions>` and :ref:`audit logging <manage/logging:audit logging>` to limit risk exposure during high-stakes operations.

Business Continuity at Scale
----------------------------

Outages and downtime threaten both productivity and revenue. In large enterprises, the cost of silence can be measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars per minute.

**Benefits**

- **Enable immediate coordination during outages** using :ref:`private cloud or hybrid deployment options <deploy/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` to maintain operational continuity outside your primary infrastructure.
- **Scale communication globally** with Mattermost’s :doc:`high availability and horizontal scalability architecture </scale/scaling-for-enterprise>`—supporting tens of thousands of users across enterprise, field, or classified environments.
- **Accelerate outage recovery** using :doc:`Collaborative Playbooks </guides/repeatable-processes>` that automate outage response steps and ensure team accountability during time-critical events.

Incident Response in Crisis Conditions
--------------------------------------

Cyber breaches demand swift, coordinated action across affected teams. Every delay in communication heightens risk.

**Benefits**

- **Ensure secure response coordination** through :doc:`private 1:1 calling and screen sharing </collaborate/make-calls>` for uninterrupted incident discussions within an isolated Mattermost environment.
- **Confirm alerts and share threat intelligence** with integrated tools like ServiceNow, Prometheus, and Grafana via the :doc:`Mattermost integrations platform </about/integrations>`.
- **Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR)** by executing :doc:`structured incident playbooks </guides/repeatable-processes>` that handle triage, task assignment, and escalation with full visibility and auditability.

Sensitive or Classified Collaboration
--------------------------------------

Not all communication is appropriate for general collaboration platforms. Teams managing high-value or sensitive data need secure, isolated spaces for sensitive strategic planning or response operations.

**Benefits**

- **Protect classified communications** with STIG-hardened, DISA-approved container images built for use in air-gapped or classified networks.
- **Enable secure collaboration** through :doc:`threaded messaging </collaborate/organize-conversations>`, :doc:`file sharing </collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`, and :ref:`channel-level access controls <manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>` hosted in sovereign infrastructure.
- **Maintain IP confidentiality** with end-to-end encrypted, :doc:`self-hosted deployments </deploy/server/server-deployment-planning>` that eliminate reliance on third-party SaaS and ensure data sovereignty.
