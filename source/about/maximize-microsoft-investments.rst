The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement
-------------------------------------------

As Skype for Business reaches end-of-life, secure organizations require an alternative that preserves on-premises control, integrates into Microsoft workflows, and meets the security standards of air-gapped and classified environments. Cloud-first replacements like Microsoft Teams are not always viable due to network segmentation, compliance restrictions, or data sovereignty mandates.

- **Preserve mission-critical communication workflows** with a self-hosted Mattermost deployment that supports :doc:`1:1 calls </collaborate/make-calls>`, :ref:`screen sharing <collaborate/make-calls:share your screen>`, and :doc:`threaded messaging </collaborate/organize-conversations>` within secure environments.
- **Integrate Mattermost with Microsoft tools** such as Outlook, Teams, and :doc:`Entra ID Single Sign-On </onboard/sso-entraid>` to retain user workflows while centralizing identity and access control. See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Deploy in sovereign, air-gapped, or private cloud environments** such as `Azure Deployment <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-operator?tab=overview>`_ while maintaining compliance with STIG, FedRAMP, and NIST 800-53 standards.

Out-of-Band Incident Response for Microsoft-Centric Environments
-----------------------------------------------------------------

During high-stakes incidents, Microsoft 365 tools can be limited or unavailable, slowing down response times and jeopardizing mission continuity.

**Benefits**

- **Maintain operational continuity during M365 outages** with a dedicated, out-of-band Mattermost instance for secure incident response, communication, and collaboration. See :doc:`Mattermost Mission Collaboration for Microsoft </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`
- **Accelerate responses** with :doc:`AI-powered workflows </configure/agents-admin-guide>`, enabling structured playbooks for triage, escalation, and resolution even when primary systems are compromised.
- **Integrate with Microsoft Security Suite** and :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>` to preserve centralized identity management while keeping sensitive data in a secure secondary system. :doc:`Learn more </about/integrations>` about Mattermost's integration capabilities.
- **Protect breach-sensitive notifications** using :ref:`ID-only push alerts <configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>` and enhanced mobile security, enabling secure communication without cloud exposure.

Enterprise to Tactical Edge
----------------------------

Operational teams need to extend Microsoft capabilities to mission environments where bandwidth is limited, systems are segregated, and speed is critical.

    :alt: Secure, Mission-Focused Collaboration to Enable Faster, Informed Decision-Making across Environments.

**Benefits**

- **Enable mission-critical coordination at the edge** by :ref:`deploying Mattermost in secure, on-prem or air-gapped environments <deploy/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>` :doc:`integrated with Microsoft Teams and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Fuse data and decision-making across platforms** with support for :doc:`toolchain integration </about/integrations>`, :doc:`audio/screen share </collaborate/make-calls>`, and :doc:`workflow automation </guides/repeatable-processes>` embedded into a dedicated Mission Operations Platform.
- **Maintain coalition and partner alignment** through :doc:`interoperable Connected Workspaces </onboard/connected-workspaces>` supporting collaboration across mission partner networks.
- **Accelerate action with mission-tuned AI** using secure Azure AI and :doc:`Mattermost Copilot </guides/agents>` to summarize context, guide decisions, and automate operational tasks.
- **Secure every communication path** with built-in :doc:`Zero Trust controls </about/security/zero-trust>` and deploy on Azure or sovereign environments for maximum flexibility and compliance.


External Collaboration with Full Control
------------------------------------------

Managing external collaboration within Microsoft Teams can be complex, often requiring numerous configurations and administration that lead to security risks like usage of consumer-grade chat tools.

    :alt: Mattermost replaces Signal, Discord and other free personal apps with secure external messaging controlled by IT.

**Benefits**

- **Integrate Mattermost with Microsoft Teams and Outlook** to enable secure external collaboration with encryption, audit trails, and role-based permissions—without compromising compliance. (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`).
- **Eliminate shadow IT** by providing :doc:`Connected Workspaces </onboard/connected-workspaces>` for sanctioned, policy-enforced engagement with external partners—reducing reliance on consumer-grade tools.
- **Apply granular policy enforcement for external users**, including :ref:`granular user permissions <manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`, :doc:`legal hold </comply/legal-hold>`, :doc:`retention policies </comply/data-retention-policy>`, and :doc:`custom Terms of Service </comply/custom-terms-of-service>`.
- **Synchronize user identity** using :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>` to maintain scalable, centralized access control across both internal and external collaborators.

Sovereign Communication in Microsoft Teams
-------------------------------------------

Agencies and critical infrastructure organizations must often comply with strict data sovereignty rules that restrict cloud usage for sensitive collaboration.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy Mattermost on-premise or in sovereign clouds**, fully integrated with Microsoft Teams and Outlook (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`) to maintain workflow continuity and secure data storage.
- **Store messages, recordings, and transcriptions in compliance-approved systems**, with :ref:`data-at-rest encryption <about/security:data-at-rest encryption>` ensuring no leakage of sensitive data to third-party platforms.
- **Enable secure Microsoft Teams interactions via embedded Mattermost collaboration**, supporting operations within familiar interfaces while enforcing regulatory compliance. See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Enforce agency-specific policies** with :doc:`legal hold </comply/legal-hold>`, :doc:`retention policies </comply/data-retention-policy>`, and :doc:`user access controls </onboard/advanced-permissions>` that align with national or sectoral mandates.

Cross-Instance Collaboration Hub
---------------------------------

Multi-agency, multi-tenant Microsoft 365 environments often hinder seamless collaboration and increase complexity for inter-organization workflows.

**Benefits**

- **Centralize communication across M365 instances** using Mattermost as a neutral, embedded hub for messaging, file sharing, and playbook coordination (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`).
- **Bridge segmented Teams deployments** with :doc:`Connected Workspaces </onboard/connected-workspaces>` and Microsoft presence integration to ensure continuity without duplicative configuration.
- **Deploy flexibly across hybrid, private, or air-gapped environments** such as :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>` to ensure operational consistency no matter the deployment complexity.
- **Secure external communications and maintain control** with segmentation, data governance, and compliance automation across Teams ecosystems.
