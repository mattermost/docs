Designed for operational teams that require advanced customization, secure workflows, and seamless deployment on segregated networks, Mattermost enhances your existing Microsoft solutions for critical mission success.  

Mattermost complements Microsoft solutions with tailored capabilities designed to meet the unique needs of high-security environments, inter-agency collaboration, and external workflows, enabling teams to maximize their Microsoft investment.

Mission-ready collaboration capabilities include: 

On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement
-------------------------------------------

As Skype for Business reaches end-of-life, secure organizations require an alternative that preserves on-premises control, integrates into Microsoft workflows, and meets the security standards of air-gapped and classified environments. Cloud-first replacements like Microsoft Teams are not always viable due to network segmentation, compliance restrictions, or data sovereignty mandates.

- **Preserve mission-critical communication workflows** with a self-hosted Mattermost deployment that supports 1:1 calls, screen sharing, and threaded messaging within secure environments. See: :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`
- **Integrate Mattermost with Microsoft tools** such as Outlook, Teams, and `Entra ID Single Sign-On </onboard/sso-entraid>_` to retain user workflows while centralizing identity and access control.
- **Deploy in sovereign, air-gapped, or private cloud environments** such as `Azure Deployment <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-operator?tab=overview>`_ to maintain compliance with STIG, FedRAMP, and NIST 800-53 standards.

Out-of-Band Incident Response for Microsoft-Centric Environments
-----------------------------------------------------------------

During high-stakes incidents, Microsoft 365 tools can be limited or unavailable, slowing down response times and jeopardizing mission continuity.

**Benefits**

- **Maintain operational continuity during M365 outages** with a dedicated, out-of-band Mattermost instance for secure incident response, communication, and collaboration. See: :doc:`Playbooks in Microsoft Teams </integrate/playbooks-for-microsoft-teams>`
- **Accelerate response with :ref:`AI-powered workflows <configure/enable-copilot:mattermost configuration>`**, enabling structured playbooks for triage, escalation, and resolution even when primary systems are compromised.
- **Integrate with Microsoft Security Suite and :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>`** to preserve centralized identity management while keeping sensitive data in a secure secondary system.
- **Protect breach-sensitive notifications** using ID-only push alerts and encrypted mobility, enabling secure communication without cloud exposure.

External Collaboration with Full Control
----------------------------------------------------

Managing external collaboration within Microsoft Teams can be complex, often requiring numerous configurations and administration that lead to security risks like usage of consumer-grade chat tools.

**Benefits**

- **Integrate Mattermost with Microsoft Teams and Outlook** (:doc:`Microsoft Teams Sync </collaborate/collaborate-within-connected-microsoft-teams>`) to enable secure external collaboration with encryption, audit trails, and role-based permissions—without compromising compliance.
- **Eliminate shadow IT by providing Shared Channels** for sanctioned, policy-enforced engagement with external partners—reducing reliance on consumer-grade tools.
- **Apply granular policy enforcement for external users**, including read-only roles, legal hold, retention policies, and custom Terms of Service.
- **Synchronize user identity via :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>`** to maintain scalable, centralized access control across both internal and external collaborators.

Sovereign Communication in Microsoft Teams  
-------------------------------------------

Agencies and critical infrastructure organizations must often comply with strict data sovereignty rules that restrict cloud usage for sensitive collaboration.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy Mattermost on-premise or in sovereign clouds**, fully integrated with Microsoft Teams and Outlook (:doc:`Join Microsoft Team Meetings </integrate/microsoft-teams-meetings>`) to maintain workflow continuity and secure data storage.
- **Store messages, recordings, and transcriptions in compliance-approved systems**, ensuring no leakage of sensitive data to third-party platforms.
- **Enable secure Microsoft Teams interactions via embedded Mattermost collaboration**, supporting operations within familiar interfaces while enforcing regulatory compliance.
- **Enforce agency-specific policies** with legal hold, retention, and user access controls that align with national or sectoral mandates.

Cross-Instance Collaboration Hub
---------------------------------

Multi-agency, multi-tenant Microsoft 365 environments often hinder seamless collaboration and increase complexity for inter-organization workflows.

**Benefits**

- **Centralize communication across M365 instances** using Mattermost as a neutral, embedded hub for messaging, file sharing, and playbook coordination (:doc:`Playbooks in Microsoft Teams </integrate/playbooks-for-microsoft-teams>`).
- **Bridge segmented Teams deployments** with Shared Channels and Microsoft presence integration to ensure continuity without duplicative configuration.
- **Deploy flexibly across hybrid, private, or air-gapped environments** such as :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>` to ensure operational consistency no matter the deployment complexity.
- **Secure external communications and maintain control** with segmentation, data governance, and compliance automation across Teams ecosystems.
