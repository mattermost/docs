Maximize Your Microsoft Investments
===================================

Unlock the full potential of your Microsoft Teams, M365, and Entra ID investment with Mattermost. Designed for operational teams that require advanced customization, secure workflows, and seamless deployment on segregated networks, Mattermost enhances your existing Microsoft solutions for critical mission success.  

Mattermost complements Microsoft solutions with tailored capabilities designed to meet the unique needs of high-security environments, inter-agency collaboration, and external workflows, enabling teams to maximize their Microsoft investment.

The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement
-------------------------------------------

As Skype for Business reaches end-of-life, secure organizations require an alternative that preserves on-premises control, integrates into Microsoft workflows, and meets the security standards of air-gapped and classified environments. Cloud-first replacements like Microsoft Teams are not always viable due to network segmentation, compliance restrictions, or data sovereignty mandates.

- **Preserve mission-critical communication workflows** with a self-hosted Mattermost deployment that supports :doc:`1:1 calls </collaborate/make-calls>`, :ref:`screen sharing <collaborate/make-calls:share your screen>`, and :doc:`threaded messaging </collaborate/organize-conversations>` within secure environments.
- **Integrate Mattermost with Microsoft tools** such as Outlook, Teams, and :doc:`Entra ID Single Sign-On </onboard/sso-entraid>` to retain user workflows while centralizing identity and access control. See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Deploy in sovereign, air-gapped, or private cloud environments** such as `Azure Deployment <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mattermost.mattermost-operator?tab=overview>`_ while maintaining compliance with STIG, FedRAMP, and NIST 800-53 standards.

Out-of-Band Incident Response for Microsoft-Centric Environments
-----------------------------------------------------------------

During high-stakes incidents, Microsoft 365 tools can be limited or unavailable, slowing down response times and jeopardizing mission continuity.

**Benefits**

- **Maintain operational continuity during M365 outages** with a dedicated, out-of-band Mattermost instance for secure incident response, communication, and collaboration. See :doc:`Playbooks in Microsoft Teams </integrate/playbooks-for-microsoft-teams>`
- **Accelerate responses** with :ref:`AI-powered workflows <configure/enable-copilot:mattermost configuration>`, enabling structured playbooks for triage, escalation, and resolution even when primary systems are compromised.
- **Integrate with Microsoft Security Suite** and :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>` to preserve centralized identity management while keeping sensitive data in a secure secondary system. :doc:`Learn more </about/integrations>` about Mattermost's integration capabilities.
- **Protect breach-sensitive notifications** using :ref:`ID-only push alerts <configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>` and enhanced mobile security, enabling secure communication without cloud exposure.

External Collaboration with Full Control
------------------------------------------

Managing external collaboration within Microsoft Teams can be complex, often requiring numerous configurations and administration that lead to security risks like usage of consumer-grade chat tools.

**Benefits**

- **Integrate Mattermost with Microsoft Teams and Outlook** to enable secure external collaboration with encryption, audit trails, and role-based permissions—without compromising compliance. (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`).
- **Eliminate shadow IT** by providing :doc:`Connected Workspaces </onboard/connected-workspaces>` for sanctioned, policy-enforced engagement with external partners—reducing reliance on consumer-grade tools.
- **Apply granular policy enforcement for external users**, including :ref:`granular user permissions <manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`, :doc:`legal hold </comply/legal-hold>`, :doc:`retention policies </comply/data-retention-policy>`, and :doc:`custom Terms of Service </comply/custom-terms-of-service>`.
- **Synchronize user identity** using :doc:`Entra ID </onboard/sso-entraid>` to maintain scalable, centralized access control across both internal and external collaborators.

Sovereign Communication in Microsoft Teams  
-------------------------------------------

Agencies and critical infrastructure organizations must often comply with strict data sovereignty rules that restrict cloud usage for sensitive collaboration.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy Mattermost on-premise or in sovereign clouds**, fully integrated with Microsoft Teams and Outlook (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`) to maintain workflow continuity and secure data storage.
- **Store messages, recordings, and transcriptions in compliance-approved systems**, with :ref:`data-at-rest encryption <about/security:data-at-rest encryption>` ensuring no leakage of sensitive data to third-party platforms.
- **Enable secure Microsoft Teams interactions via embedded Mattermost collaboration**, supporting operations within familiar interfaces while enforcing regulatory compliance. See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`.
- **Enforce agency-specific policies** with :doc:`legal hold </comply/legal-hold>`, :doc:`retention policies </comply/data-retention-policy>`, and :doc:`user access controls </onboard/advanced-permissions>` that align with national or sectoral mandates.

Cross-Instance Collaboration Hub
---------------------------------

Multi-agency, multi-tenant Microsoft 365 environments often hinder seamless collaboration and increase complexity for inter-organization workflows.

**Benefits**

- **Centralize communication across M365 instances** using Mattermost as a neutral, embedded hub for messaging, file sharing, and playbook coordination (See :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`).
- **Bridge segmented Teams deployments** with :doc:`Connected Workspaces </onboard/connected-workspaces>` and Microsoft presence integration to ensure continuity without duplicative configuration.
- **Deploy flexibly across hybrid, private, or air-gapped environments** such as :doc:`Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrate/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>` to ensure operational consistency no matter the deployment complexity.
- **Secure external communications and maintain control** with segmentation, data governance, and compliance automation across Teams ecosystems.
