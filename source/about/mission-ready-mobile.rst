Mission-Ready Mobile
====================

**When frontline teams lose access to primary systems, coordination breaks down—along with the mission. Mattermost keeps teams connected through secure, self-hosted mobile collaboration—built to operate in disconnected, degraded, or high-security environments.**

Field operations across defense, public safety, disaster response, and critical infrastructure routinely push beyond the limits of cloud-first tools. Mobile coordination becomes essential, but most platforms require constant connectivity and third-party infrastructure—introducing unacceptable risk.

Mattermost eliminates these dependencies. With an offline-capable, policy-controlled mobile experience, Mattermost enables resilient collaboration in the field while giving organizations full control over infrastructure, access, and data.
