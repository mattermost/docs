Micro-segmentation
-------------------

Segmenting and isolating sensitive resources is vital in minimizing lateral movement during an attack. Mattermost supports micro-segmentation through its organizational and role-based capabilities. Micro-segmentation enables organizations to restrict access to sensitive conversations, ensuring secure communication channels tailored to individual teams or missions.  

Access control and permissions

Continuous monitoring
----------------------

To align with an always verify philosophy, Mattermost offers tools for monitoring activity, identifying suspicious behavior, session management, and real-time incident response. Audit trails and performance monitoring ensure proactive detection of potential issues or breaches, delivering visibility into the activity across the platform. Session management strengthens the protection against session hijacking or unauthorized persistent access.

- `SIEM Integrations <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/>`_: Streamlines monitoring within existing security systems to detect and respond to threats consistently with Zero Trust principles.
- `Performance Monitoring <https://docs.mattermost.com/scale/deploy-prometheus-grafana-for-performance-monitoring.html>`_: Protects against potential threats by analyzing system and user behaviors via proactive monitoring.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
----------------------------------

Adding an extra layer of protection beyond passwords is essential for Zero Trust. Mattermost supports MFA to strengthen authentication practices. MFA ensures that unauthorized users are denied access even if passwords are compromised, reducing the risk of account breaches.  

Alternatively, often enforced through the identity provider (IDP).  

- `MFA <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/multi-factor-authentication.html>`_: Enhances user identity verification by requiring multiple factors for authentication in adherence to Zero Trust standards.

Encryption
----------

Encryption protects both data at rest and data in transit, ensuring end-to-end security for sensitive communications. Encryption mitigates the risk of data theft in both storage and transfer, while granular permissions limit access to sensitive files and data to only authorized users.  

- `Database Encryption <https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/encryption-options.html#database>`_: Protects user and organizational data at rest, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- `TLS Encryption <https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/encryption-options.html#encryption-in-transit>`_: Secures data in transit by encrypting communications.

File storage encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File storage encryption is a foundational tool in the Zero Trust model because it enforces strict data access policies, protects against both external and internal threats, and fortifies the organization's overall data protection strategy.  

- `Policy Enforcement <https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/encryption-options.html#file-storage>`_: Ensures strict compliance through automated enforcement, protecting data integrity with Zero Trust-based configurations.
- `Granular Permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/delegated-granular-administration.html>`_: Facilitates precise control over user and system permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- `Read-Only Permissions for Files <https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/site-configuration-settings.html#file-sharing-and-downloads>`_: Limits file-sharing capabilities to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized alterations.

Data management
---------------

Data management is a critical pillar of the Zero Trust security model because it directly addresses how sensitive information is managed, controlled, and safeguarded at every stage of the data lifecycle. In the core principle of never trust, always verify, proper data retention practices ensure that data is not only securely stored but also that it is not retained longer than necessary, thereby reducing risks.  

By retaining data only for the duration that it is needed and then securely disposing of it, the exposure to malicious activity or unauthorized access is significantly reduced. Even if attackers gain access, their exposure is minimized. The less data stored, the smaller the "footprint" for potential exploitation.  

- `Data Retention Policies <https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/data-retention-policy.html>`_: Enforces strict retention controls to reduce data exposure and help comply with Zero Trust governance standards.
- `Compliance Export <https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/compliance-export.html>`_: Ensures data portability for audit and compliance purposes in a secure and controlled manner.
- `Compliance Monitoring <https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/compliance-monitoring.html>`_: Offers visibility into adherence to security and compliance policies, supporting Zero Trust-based compliance mandates.
- `E-Discovery <https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/electronic-discovery.html>`_: Boosts organizational oversight by ensuring discoverability of stored data for legal and compliance audits under secure protocols.

Incident response
------------------

Incident response is a critical component of a Zero Trust security model because it ensures that organizations can effectively detect, investigate, and respond to security threats within a framework that assumes no entity—whether inside or outside the network—should be trusted by default.  

Incident response is the operational arm that enforces the core principle of Zero Trust—never trust, always verify—by ensuring that organizations are vigilant, prepared, and capable of protecting themselves in a dynamic and evolving threat landscape.
