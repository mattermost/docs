# Signing in
_____

You can sign in to your team from the web address of `https://domain.com/teamname`. 

## Sign In Methods
There are several options for signing in to your team depending on how your System Admin has configured your server. 

#### Email Address or Username Sign In  

When enabled by your System Admin, you can sign in with the username or email address used to create your account.

If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking **I forgot my password** on the sign in screen, or contact your System Admin for help resetting your password. 

#### GitLab Single-Sign-On (SSO)

When enabled by your System Admin, you can sign in using your GitLab account using a one-click sign in option. GitLab SSO lets you create teams, create accounts on teams, and sign in to teams using one username, email address, and password that works across everything on the server.  

## Switching Teams

When you've used the same email address to sign up and sign in to multiple teams, you can switch among those teams using the **Main Menu**, accessed by clicking the three dots in the top header of any team site on the server. By default, devices remember which teams you have signed into for 30 days.

## Logging Out

You can log out from the **Main Menu**, which is accessed by clicking the three dots in the top header on the left side of the screen. Clicking "Logout" logs you out of all teams that are signed in and open in your browser.

## iOS Setup

Your Mattermost teams can be accessed on iOS mobile devices by downloading the Mattermost App.

1. Open the App Store on your Apple device running iOS 9.0 or later.
2. Search for "Mattermost" and click **GET** to download the App for free.
3. Open Mattermost from your homescreen and input your team and account information to login:
    1. Enter Team URL: This is part of the web address that navigates to your team on the system domain. You can find the Team URL by asking your System Admin or looking at the address bar in a desktop browser tab with Mattermost open. It is in the form `https://domain.com/teamurl/`.
    2. Sign in to Mattermost: This is your account login information as decribed by one of the sign in methods above.
