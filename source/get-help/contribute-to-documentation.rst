Contribute to this documentation
================================

Mattermost has a diverse community that extends well beyond code contributions. If you're interested in contributing to Mattermost, why not help improve the documentation? Be sure to join the documentation community in `DWG: Documentation Working Group <https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group>`_ so we can support and celebrate you!

How to get started
------------------

The fastest way to get started with a documentation contribution is to find something you want to change in the documentation. This might be a typo or broken link, or something more extensive like revising or expanding content. Once you've found a page you want to update, select the edit option |edit-on-github| located in the top right corner of that page. 

First-time contributor?
-----------------------

Start by exploring the `Contribute to Mattermost <https://mattermost.com/contribute/>`_ documentation, specifically the `"You want to help with content" <https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/why-contribute/#you-want-to-help-with-content>`_ section.

In a GitHub pull request, you can make changes as if you were editing code. If you're new to contributing to documentation using pull requests in GitHub, the following `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8ROl9wiHr8>`_ will help you get started:
