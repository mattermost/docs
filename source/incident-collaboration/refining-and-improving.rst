Refining and Improving
======================

Filling out a retrospective helps teams identify areas of improvement to apply to future playbook runs as well as provide stakeholders with insight into the run.

Retrospective components are customized per playbook.

Creating and publishing retrospectives
--------------------------------------

First, configure the retrospective's settings in the relevant playbook via the **Playbooks** tab. Select the playbook and then select **Edit**. Open the **Templates** and scroll down to the **Retrospective Reminder Interval** and **Retrospective Template** fields.

This sets a reminder to fill out the retrospective, which is broadcast to the channel. The template is then pre-populated in the report. Once the report is written, it's saved and is listed in the run's detailed view.
