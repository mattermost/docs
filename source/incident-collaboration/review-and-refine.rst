Retrospectives and reviews are an important part of playbooks.

Channel Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exporting the contents of an incident channel requires the channel export plugin. See the `Channel Export plugin documentation <https://mattermost.gitbook.io/channel-export-plugin>`_ for more information.

Reviewing past incidents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view past incidents of which you are a member, from the desktop or browser:

1. Navigate to **Main Menu > Incident Collaboration**.
2. Select the **Incidents** tab.
3. Within the **Incidents** tab, find the incident to be reviewed, then select the name of the incident.
4. Review the incident details:
 * The duration, total number of members ever involved, and messages sent in the channel are listed.
 * A graphical timeline shows how much time elapsed between completed checklist items.
5. Optionally export the contents of the incident channel to review during a post-mortem.
