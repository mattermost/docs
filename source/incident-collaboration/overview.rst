Overview
========

Mattermost Incident Collaboration equips your team to coordinate, manage, and resolve incidents from within Mattermost using playbooks. Each playbook represents a recurring outcome that your teams collaborate to achieve, such as Service Outage Recovery or Customer Onboarding. For the participants, it prescribes processes such as task checklists, status updates, and retrospective reports. For the integrated tools, it configures the triggers to perform automate actions. And for stakeholders, it provides a single pane of glass for visibility into each run as well as aggregate insights over time.

Teams run a playbook every time they want to orchestrate people, tools, and data to achieve that outcome as quickly as possible while providing visibility to stakeholders. They also incorporate learnings from the retrospective to tweak and improve the playbook with every iteration.

Every reported incident or new checklist results in a newly-created, public or private incident channel exposing a custom user interface for collaboration, resolution, and feedback.

* Starting a playbook run automatically creates a dedicated incident channel to coordinate discussion. 
  
  - Use custom categories in the channel sidebar to streamline access to ongoing playbook runs.

* Playbooks define the tasks toward resolution as your team manages the event.
  
  - Define your playbooks in advance with automated actions such as creating a Jira ticket, starting a Zoom call, or finding out who is on-call in Opsgenie.

* Reviewing the timeline and conversation helps refine the process for future events.
  
  - Export the incident channel conversation to conduct a post-mortem review.

Delivering more reliable services requires an efficient resolution process. Use Mattermost Incident Collaboration not only to resolve incidents more efficiently, but also to refine the process your team relies upon for success.
