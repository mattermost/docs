What is Incident Collaboration?
-------------------------------

Mattermost Incident Collaboration is a multi-purpose checklist tool. You can use it to manage **incidents** which are situations that require an immediate response or you can use it for workflow **checklists** which support regularly-used processes such as staff onboarding. Every reported incident or new checklist results in a newly-created, public or private incident channel exposing a custom user interface for collaboration, resolution, and feedback.

* **Playbooks** are a collection of checklists to define and guide anincident toward resolution. Playbooks are created in advance by creating the tasks, checklists, and other configurations used during an incident.
* **Tasks** are the actions to be taken when resolving an incident. As the necessary work is completed, the team should mark the tasks as complete. During an incident, tasks may be assigned to a member of the incident channel to communicate ownership.
* The **Commander** drives the incident or process. This person is responsible for ensuring forward momentum on resolving the incident. By default, the reporter of the incident starts as the commander, but the commander may be changed at any time to another member of the incident channel.
* **Slash commands** may be assigned to tasks defined in the playbook to help to streamline common actions.
