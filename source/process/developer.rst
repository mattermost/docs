====================================
Developers
====================================

At Mattermost, staff developers are thoughtful, highly independent engineers who work with both our open source contributor community and other Mattermost staff to improve our software on a regular basis.

All Mattermost staff developers are also `core committers <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html#core-committers>`_ on one or more official Mattermost repositories. They work closely with product management to envision, design, plan, develop, coordinate, review and merge improvements per our `contribution guidelines <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html>`_ on a regular basis. 

Ideally, developers are "full stack", and comfortable moving across backend and frontend projects. As part of our `learn, master, teach <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#learn-master-teach>`_ mindset, our environment has people consistently cross-training, becoming experts and passing on knowledge to new team members rotating into new areas of responsibility. That said, we also welcome engineers who prefer to specialize in backend and frontend, since there's ample projects to find in both areas.  

Responsibilities
-------------------------

- Develop features from proposal to polished end result.
- Support and collaborate with our community service engineers to find the root cause of issues, find, deliver and document effective solutions. 
- Engage with the core team and the open source community to collaborate on improving Mattermost.
- Propose, coordinate, manage, review and merge code contributed by the rest of the community and work with them to get it ready for production.
- Work with our `documentation team <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/documentation-guidelines.html?>`_ to create and maintain technical information around features, configuration and troubleshooting. 
- Take initiative in improving the software in small or large ways to address pain points in your own experience as a developer.
- Keep code easy to maintain. Keep it easy for others to contribute code.
- Help identify, vet and recruit other developers to join our community and, when appropriate, as staff developers. 

Requirements 
-------------------------

- You can effectively reason and discuss software, algorithms, and performance at a high level
- You have a passion for creating open source software 
- You have previously played a vital role in production-level applications 
- You have strong written communication skills.
- You're self-motivated with strong organizational skills.
- You share our values, and work in accordance with those values.
- You're proficient in Golang, React and/or React Native, or are able to ramp quickly into those languages. 
- You're ready to complete our `technical interview`_ process.
- Ideal, but not required: Experience working in online communities, having made at least one `Help Wanted <https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Amattermost+state%3Aopen+Help+Wanted&type=Issues&ref=searchresults?>`_ pull request to a Mattermost repository, working on other Golang, React or React Native apps. 

Internships 
-------------------------

While we no longer offer internships for developers, if you get a couple of `Help Wanted <https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Amattermost+state%3Aopen+Help+Wanted&type=Issues&ref=searchresults?>`_ pull requests accepted, we'll interview you for one. This will be a remote internship without supervision; you'll only get feedback on your merge requests. If you want to work on open source and qualify `please submit an application <https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/>`_. In the cover letter field, please note that you want an internship and link to the accepted pull requests. The pull requests should be of significant value and difficulty, which is at the discretion of the hiring manager. For example, fixing 10 typos isn't as valuable as shipping 2 new features.

Hiring Process
-------------------------

Applicants for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below. Please keep in mind that applicants can be declined from the position at any stage of the process. 

Both declined and accepted candidates will be invited to share feedback on their hiring experience so we can continually improve our process.

If you'd like to share privately we can send you our ID for GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket, or we can review code you send in via email. 
- **Email - Follow-up questions** - If your code samples look good, we'll email you some questions specific to the role. 
- **Video call - Screening interview** - Selected candidates will be invited for a 30-minute screening call with a recruiter. 
- **Video call - Soft-skills discussion** - Next, candidates will be invited to schedule a 15-minute interview with a staff developer to assess soft skills.

Technical Interview
----------------------------

For some positions, the hiring process includes a technical interview in order for you and the interviewer to understand what our work here is really like, and how you think, code and collaborate. 

In the technical interview, you will work on an issue in our `Help Wanted <https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Amattermost+state%3Aopen+Help+Wanted&type=Issues&ref=searchresults?>`_  list in a 1-hour screen sharing session with the interviewer, and code "live", with them there to talk and collaborate with.

After the interview, you will be asked to spend some time to finish the work, get it as close to done as your time allows, and submit a pull request with the changes to the Mattermost open source project. The interviewer will then review it, leave feedback, and ask you to look at the feedback and potentially make changes to address it. After at most 2 cycles of review by the interviewer and changes by you, the interviewer will let you know whether Mattermost will move forward with your candidacy, or not.

The work after the screen sharing session, before submitting the pull request for the first review cycle, is expected to take around one hour. But as mentioned above, feel free to extend this time according to your availability, there is no time constraint.

The time taken on the review cycles should normally take around two hours. While you are welcome to spend more time on this if you choose to, we will not ask you to do so. If you do not have time to do everything you'd like to, please mention those extra items in the pull request description.

You are encouraged to let the interviewer know when you feel like you are getting close to having spent more time on the merge request than is reasonable. In this case, they will make a decision on your candidacy then, based on the information gathered during the technical interview and the work on the pull request up to that point. We do need at least one review cycle before evaluating your candidacy, so please bear that in mind if you're spending more than one hour before submitting the initial merge request.

Once the pull request is finished, the code you have written will go into Mattermost Team Edition to the benefit of thousands of organizations using this free, open-source product, but will also go into the proprietary Mattermost Enterprise Edition, which is a commercial extension of the open source project. When contributing code, you should follow the `code contribution guidelines <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html>`_, and complete the individual contributor license agreement.

If you prefer not to do the above, please let us know and we'll give you an assignment that does not relate to Mattermost but does test the relevant skills.
