Creating and Editing Mattermost Userâ€™s Guide
====================================================================================

This document describes the best practices for creating `Mattermost documentation for end users <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/user.html>`__.

Follow these steps:

1. Start the document by describing the benefits of the feature for end users (`please see this example <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/attaching-files.html>`__).

2. Proceed to explain how to use the feature - use short bullet points as well as screenshots as applicable.

3. Include useful tips as applicable.

If a document includes multiple features that are related to each other, order them based on which functionality is used 
the most, e.g.: how to attach files > file previewer > sharing public links.
