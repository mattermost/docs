Staging Process
=====================

This document outlines the process that should be used in staging, in order to avoid the following issues:
 - There is no way to tell if people have work in progress.
 - It is unclear when/how often we push, which can then lead to bugs not being pushed live as soon as is desired.

All members in the marketing team should be aware of the following steps:

1. Every time you make an update on staging, post to Website Marketing channel starting with the web hashtag 
and a description of the change made
 - If it's something that will take a while, post when you start making an edit just so other people have visibility 
 into what you're doing
 - If you publish an update, make sure you preview it before publishing and do a quick test to make sure 
 there are no issues
 - I'm going to look into automating getting the description of changes into a spreadsheet, so we have a record 
 of what changed and when
2. All changes go through Asaad, unless it’s something minor like editing text or creating a new text based page.
 - If something breaks, propose we limit or revoke wordpress permissions until there’s a development environment.
3. Start pushing website daily if changes were made.
 - Make sure Recapthca keys in the Trial page are updated in production.
