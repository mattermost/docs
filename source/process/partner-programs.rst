Partner Directory 
------------------

A directory of Mattermost partners can be found at https://mattermost.com/partners/.

After completion of a partner agreement, partners are invited to send an overview of their services with a logo to inclusion in the Mattermost partner directory. 

To get started, please email the following to partner-directory@mattermost.com:

- **Partner Name:** Your legal name may be shortened to fit in the directory listing. If you wish you can state your full legal name as part of your partner description.
- **Partner Contact Information:** The best email address (and phone number, if preferred) where you can be reached.
- **Partner Description:** Between 30-100 words describing your business. See examples at https://mattermost.com/partners/.
- **City, State/Province, and Country:** Location of key office or offices providing Mattermost services, or global headquarters.

If you have joined the Value-Added Reseller program, your reseller territory will appear in the listing as well.

Listing Location of Key Office
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the partner listing, city locations follow a "concise clarity" principle:

- Cities that are not well-known, or which have very similarly-named cities in the same country, are displayed as CITY, STATE/PROVINCE, COUNTRY.
- Well-known and uniquely-named cities, display is CITY, COUNTRY.

For example: A well-known city with a unique name like Johannesburg would be displayed as "Johannesburg, South Africa" and not "Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa", which is unnecessarily long. Similarly a less well-known city, like "Arvada" is referenced as "Arvada, Colorado, USA".

Mattermost Partner Program FAQ 
------------------------------

Frequently asked questions from Mattermost partners.

Can a partner sell Mattermost products without revealing the name of an end customer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Mattermost, Inc. must know all end customers with whom it does business. This is important for Mattermost to be able to service and renew the end customer if the reseller relationship is discontinued. Moreover, Mattermost cannot do business with customers in countries embargoed by the United States and this must be confirmed in any commercial transaction.
