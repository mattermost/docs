Mattermost Authorized Partner Program
------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the Mattermost Authorized Reseller Program is to enable customers to purchase Mattermost Enterprise Edition via a fulfillment partner who earns a fee from the customer for reselling Mattermost into their procurement department and navigating the various approval processes, but who does not provide support or installation services. 

Companies who enter into a Mattermost Authorized Reseller agreement typically have existing relationships with customers and help them procure information technology products.

Partner Directory 
------------------------------

A directory of Mattermost partners can be found at https://about.mattermost.com/partners/

After completion of a partner agreement, partners are invited to send an overview of their services with a logo to inclusion in the Mattermost partner directory. 

To get started, please email the following to: partner-directory@mattermost.com 

- **Partner Name** - Your legal name may be shortened to fit in the directory listing. If you wish you can state your full legal name as part of your partner description 
- **Partner Description** - 30-100 words describing your business. See examples at https://about.mattermost.com/partners/
- **City, State/Province and Country** - Location of key office or offices providing Mattermost services, or global headquarters. 
- **Logo** - At least 200px wide

If you have joined the Value-Added Reseller program, your reseller territory will appear in the listing as well. 

Listing Location of Key Office
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the partner listing, city locations follow a "concise clarity" principle:  

- Cities that are not well-known, or which have very similiarly named cities in the same country, are displayed as CITY, STATE/PROVINCE, COUNTRY
- Otherwise for well-known and uniquely named cities, display is CITY, COUNTRY. For example: A well-known city with a unique name like 

Johanesberg would be displayed as "Johannesburg, South Africa" and not "Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa", which is unnecessarily long. Similiarly a not well-known city, like "Arvada" is referenced as "Arvada, Colorado, USA".

Partner Evaluation License
