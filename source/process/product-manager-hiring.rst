Audition
-------------------------------

For the benefit of candidates and the company, Mattermost offers real-world “try out” projects with Mattermost team members to simulate what it would be like to work at the company prior to hiring. The practice of auditions in open source companies was pioneered by Automattic (creators of WordPress) and detailed by `Harvard Business Review in 2014 <https://hbr.org/2014/04/the-ceo-of-automattic-on-holding-auditions-to-build-a-strong-team>`__. This practice has been a vital part of Mattermost culture.

Candidates who show strong potential for technical and cultural fit are invited to work on a project designed by their potential manager. While you’re working with us, you can join the Mattermost community site `here <https://community.mattermost.com/core/>`__.

Once signed-in, feel free to join channels to observe how our core staff and community members work together. Observing these public channels as you work will give you a good sense of what it is like to work at Mattermost in a full time capacity to ensure that joining the company aligns to your interests and desired career direction.

During the tryout, candidates will submit invoices for up to 40 hours of work (example `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lx1f3nX64pJTJOttW_QoJwrfRekh0ISjmIwZ7_ePG1g/edit#gid=1>`__). All candidates will be paid $25/hour, regardless of position. Mattermost uses a `standard consulting agreement template <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit?usp=sharing>`__ and provides instructions for invoicing at the start of the tryout. Note that the hourly rate is not necessarily representative of the final offer that would be extended to a successful candidate.
