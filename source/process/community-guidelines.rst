How to get community involved in a campaign?
---------------------------------------------------------

Examples include React Native Apps, Redux, and APIv4 campaigns.

Onboarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a blog post for the `Developer Blog <https://developers.mattermost.com/blog/>`_ letting developers know about the campaign and ways to contribute.  
2. Create a contribution guide. This can be part of the blog post.
3. Create Help Wanted tickets that a community member could work on.
 
For a high priority Help Wanted ticket, reach out to contributors directly in the GitHub repository for best engagement

Retention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Identify active contributors and thank them personally for their work.
2. For Work in Progress tickets or submitted pull requests, follow up with contributor once a week for status updates and questions to make sure contributors aren't blocked and feel comfortable asking questions. If there hasn't been activity in more than two weeks, ask if you can help them in some way.
3. Recognize everyone’s contributions (either intrinsic rewards like having their name listed on a contributor’s page or tangible like swag or gift cards)
4. If applicable, assign roles to top contributors (such as team lead, code reviewer, tester) to give a sense of ownership to the contributor

Off-boarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. When a campaign is finished, offer suggestions for other campaigns or projects they might be interested in.

How to run a community design meeting?
---------------------------------------

Objectives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Avoid blindspots in design by shaping requirements and use cases with user communities.
2. Confirm proposed approach for design aligns with solving the problem discussed.
3. Brainstorm ideas for solving open design questions.

Preparations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Research existing solutions to understand potential use cases brought up by communities.
2. Draft a proposed design for the problem - this can be a rough outline, more concrete mockups or final design.
3. Decide two meeting times: one for European and Asian communities, another for North and South American communities.

 - Avoid regional holidays
 - Aim for typical working hours in the regions
 
4. Prepare agenda.

 - Introductions of Mattermost team members part of the meeting
 - Review of use cases
 - Review of proposed design approach
 - Open discussion and Q&A
 - Actions and decisions
 - Review of next steps

5. Create a public meeting link everyone has permission to access, such as a Zoom link.
6. Prepare an RSVP form for customers, see `example here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdg5NWkI4JcAmGwL3KgoYdtirXTS4wb1GJRXd_20kX2lTo3mw/viewform>`_.

Announce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Prepare a forum post, see `example here <https://forum.mattermost.org/t/community-design-meeting-folded-reply-threads/6729>`_.
2. Tweet about it, see `example here <https://twitter.com/mattermost/status/1100235276436365312>`_.
3. Post in appropriate channels on https://community.mattermost.com.
4. Post in UserVoice if related to an existing feature proposal, see `example here <https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general/suggestions/19572469-make-threads-collapsible#{toggle_previous_statuses}>`_.
5. Ask customer success teams to share with interested customers.

Holding the Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Record the meeting. Mention that sharing video is optional.
2. Follow the agenda.
3. Thank everyone for joining the call.

After the Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Share a summary in all respective channels, including the meeting recording.
2. Send a survey asking how valuable the meeting was, feedback on additional use cases, and feedback on improving the meeting in the future. `See example here <https://community.mattermost.com/core/pl/jfcmekbw738o3f3ykbbhofkg8r>`_.

Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Do not use your personal Zoom meeting link for the call.
2. Note in all announcements that sharing video is optional.
3. Use `Mattermost` in your name to identify staff from community members on the call.
4. Consider sequencing design review meetings with design priorities.
5. Encourage less vocal attendees to share feedback via written chat.

How to run a Hackathon?

GitHub Help Wanted Issues in Mattermost-Server Repository
-----------------------------------------------------------

Goal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Increase Mattermost usage through larger and more numerous deployments via a vibrant open source community that contributes features that would not otherwise be offered.

Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Contributors get a worthwhile benefit from their contributions, from the feature directly and/or from social recognition
- Community members should have a low barrier to contribute
- Community development workflow should be clear, efficient and effective
- Help Wanted issues should avoid updates to the Enterprise repository due to complexity in code changes and unit tests.

Creating Help Wanted Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a Help Wanted issue in the `mattermost-server repository <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server>`__, follow these steps:

1. Create a ticket in Jira that is well-defined and unambiguous.

The issue should be written with the mindset that the contributor might have no or limited experience with the Mattermost code base and limited exposure to the Mattermost product.

  .. note::
    Below are a few reasons why Jira tickets for Help Wanted issues are recommended:
    
     - Jira tickets can be used to prioritize Help Wanted issues internally and are easily searchable by Mattermost staff, community, and customers.
    
     - Each Jira ticket goes through the `triage meeting <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#triage-meeting>`__ for dev and PM approval.
    
     - Zapier integration automatically creates GitHub Help Wanted issues from labelled Jira tickets, requiring no additional mana.
    
     - Resolved Jira tickets are automatically assigned to a QA, who tests them against the ``master`` branch.

2. After creating the ticket, add "(Proposed APR)" to its title, so the triage team knows to consider it for a ``help-wanted`` label.

3. If the Jira ticket is accepted as a Help Wanted issue during `triage <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#triage-meeting>`__, a ``help-wanted`` label is added. This action automatically triggers a zap that creates a new issue in the `mattermost-server repository <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server>`__.

    - To accept a ticket as a Help Wanted issue, the description should be unambiguous, and include UI description and help text so the change can be implemented and tested by any contributor.
    - The Triage team also adds the appropriate difficulty level (one of ``Introductory``, ``Intermediate`` and ``Advanced``) and programming language (``Go`` and ``ReactJS``) to the description of the Jira ticket.

4. After triage, the PM on community rotation reviews formatting of the GitHub issue and adds appropriate labels for difficulty level and programming language as defined by the Triage team.

`See an example Help Wanted issue here <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/4755>`__.

Managing Help Wanted Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a Help Wanted issue is added, the PM on community rotation is responsible for:

- Answering questions from community members, which get automatically posted in the `Community Heartbeat channel <https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-heartbeat>`__.
- Following up with a community member if there hasn't been a response for more than two weeks.

Closing Help Wanted Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a pull request for an open GitHub Help Wanted issue is merged, please ensure:

- The corresponding GitHub Help Wanted issue is closed, thanking the contributor.
- The corresponding Jira ticket is resolved.

Mattermost Community Forums
---------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for Mattermost `community forums <https://forum.mattermost.org>`__ and public Mattermost `GitHub repositories <https://github.com/mattermost>`__.

Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Support (answer everything correctly)
- Prioritize (focus help on those who help others)
- Empower (give them time to answer)
- Elevate (thank, recognize and approve their work)
- Grow (invite people to help as experts, promote people)

Response Writing Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Don't answer if unsure**
  - Ask someone who knows for sure instead of replying with an assumption or incomplete understanding.
  - Don't be afraid to re-route if you don't have the answer and are having trouble figuring it out.
- **Don't make promises**
  - Don’t say “we’ll work on it” or something similar that sets expectations that aren’t met later (e.g. after presenting to core team it turns out you can’t do it).
  - Be careful saying “that’s a good idea”, don’t just say it to be polite. Instead say something akin to “thanks for the idea”.
- **Choose positivity over negativity**
  - Avoid excuses like “we’re busy”, or “our team is small” and turn a missing feature into an invitation to share a feature idea to be upvoted.
- **Do your best to link documentation as answers**
  - Allows answers to be easily updated dynamically as documentation is updated.
  - Any questions that should be answered in docs that aren’t should turn into tickets to create that documentation (and post ticket in response).
- **Keep community end-user information secure**
  - If you come across a post that includes the person's IP address, domain name, or other information you think should not be disclosed publicly, edit the post to remove this information. Then click the **hide revision** button so that your edits won't be visible to others on the forum.
- **Be thankful**
  - Communities really respond well to being praised and thanked for their work.
  
Sample Responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If an issue has a PR submitted by community, but no associated Jira ticket, leave it open until the PR is merged.

2. If an issue has a Jira ticket with a ``help-wanted`` label, there is a Help Wanted ticket in GitHub. It can be closed with the following note:

.. code-block:: text

  Hi @username

  Thanks for the report! We have created a [Help Wanted issue here](link to GitHub issue) and are looking for community's help. Would you be interested helping with a pull request?

3. If an issue has a Jira ticket without a ``help-wanted`` label and assigned to the current release fix version for a developer to fix, it can be closed with the following note:

.. code-block:: text

  Hi @username

  Thanks for the report! We have created a [Jira ticket](link to Jira ticket) to track it. If you're interested helping with a pull request, please let us know.

4. If an issue has a Jira ticket without a ``help-wanted`` label but not assigned to the current release fix version, queue Jira ticket back to triage to ask if a help wanted issue could be created for it.

5. If the reporter doesn’t respond in two weeks, close the issue with the following note:

.. code-block:: text

  Hi @username, we haven't received an update so we'll assume that the problem is fixed or is no longer valid. 

  If you still experience the same problem, try upgrading to the latest version. 

  If the issue persists, reopen this issue with the relevant information and we'd be glad to help you where we can.

Feature Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Respond to the issue with the following note:

.. code-block:: text

  Thanks, appreciate your feedback @{username}.  

  Would you like to [contribute this in the feature idea forum](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general/) so it can be discussed, upvoted, and considered for a [help wanted ticket](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/help-wanted.html)?

  Please include a link back to this GitHub issue. If you're interested in implementing, please say so and we'll prioritize the review. 

  You get **10** votes in the feature idea forum, and each one influences the future of the project.

Licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ask someone to add a license to a GitHub repo, open an issue with the following note, titled ``Add an open source license?``:

.. code-block:: text

  Thanks for sharing this project! We'd love to use it as part of the Mattermost open source project (https://about.mattermost.com/) in our [React Native mobile app](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile) (which uses an [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)). 

  Would you consider adding a license, such as an MIT or an Apache 2.0 license? 

  To do so, in GitHub you can hit "Create new file" and name a file `LICENSE.txt`.

  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/19657017/36238482-99d7-11e6-9fd0-f507970891c7.png)

  This will prompt GitHub to offer a license template: 

  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/19657044/5a2d8b66-99d7-11e6-8164-ac7f90b10646.png)

  If you use a license it would make it easy to promote your open source project with the Mattermost community.

  Thanks kindly for your consideration.

Difficult Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To respond to tough questions, use the `SCIPAB method <https://www.mandel.com/top-ten-reasons/tools-methodology/scipab>`__ to help formulate a response and send for community lead to review.

Mattermost Twitter
---------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for Mattermost `Twitter responses <https://twitter.com/mattermost>`__.

Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Avoid acronyms**. Avoid acronyms when possible. For example, say "pull request" instead of "PR", since only a subset of tweet readers are active GitHub users. 
2. **Use the active voice**. Avoid "has", "was", "have been" when possible. For example, instead of "Hackfest has started!" say "Hackfest starts now!" 
3. **Include at most one link**. To provide a clear call to action, include at most one link per tweet and place it near the end of the tweet.
4. **Use exclamation marks only for exciting announcements**. An exclamation mark can be used when the announcement is exciting, but using an exclamation mark should be avoided when it can be confused with a signal for community to panic, e.g. "Security update released!".
5. **Be welcoming**. When asking someone to take action, use "Would you be open to" instead of "Would you like to".

Response Writing Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. When to like (heart) a tweet where Mattermost is mentioned?

 - Our team is on site at an event and tags our handle.
 - A community member shares an event we are at, received a Mattermug, or shared a positive experience and mentions us.

2. When to retweet a post?

 - A community member released an integration and mentions us.
 - Mattermug tweets from community members.
