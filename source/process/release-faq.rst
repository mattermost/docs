Release Overview
==========================

Mattermost adopts a monthly tick-tock release cycle, with a new version shipping on the 16th of each month in `binary form <http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#mattermost-team-edition>`_. 

Tick-tock refers to even-numbered releases (e.g., v5.6) containing new features, and odd-numbered releases (e.g., v5.7) containing only bug fixes and performance improvements.

The primary goal of our release cycle is to improve quality and build trust with our users in every release. A tick-tock release cycle allows new features to soak in our test environments for longer, allowing us to identify and fix bugs before releasing the features. 

There is no change to the process or release schedule for security issues. When security issues are found that warrant a patch release, we follow the `security release process outlined here <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/security-release.html>`_.

Release Numbering
-----------------

Mattermost numbers stable releases in the following format: 
**[Version Number].[Major Build Number].[Minor Build Number]**

**Version Number:**

- Purpose: Major system releases introduce significantly new functionality or change existing product behaviour 
- Release frequency: Unscheduled. Major system releases are infrequent
- Example: v1.x.x, v2.x.x

**Major Build Number:**

- Purpose: Introduce new features, bug fixes and performance improvements
- Release frequency: Monthly on the 16th of each month
- Example:

  - Even numbers (e.g. v1.2.x, v1.4.x): New features and bug fixes
  - Odd numbers (e.g. v1.3.x, v1.5.x): Quality release including performance improvements and bug fixes

**Minor Build Number:** 

- Purpose: Patch existing releases when severe bug fixes or security patches are required
- Release frequency: As required
- Example: v1.2.5, v1.2.6

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Q: Will tick-tock releases delay features?**

- A: You can view current, near term, and future priorities on `our website here <https://mattermost.com/roadmap/>`_. While tick-tock releases mean only shipping new features every other release, it improves the quality of features shipped. We want to avoid rushing to ship new features and then fixing bugs over a number of releases, and instead we focus on shipping high-quality features out the gate.
