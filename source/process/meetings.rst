Sprint Planning

- Goal: Review and discuss tickets selected by Developer for next sprint
- Attendees: (required) Each developer in sequence, plus spint planngers (one dev, one PM) (optional) Mattermost Inc. colleagues welcome

Note: 

- This meeting uses a special `Mattermost Inc only BACKLOG query <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&view=planning.nodetail&quickFilter=7>`_ showing tickets by sprint, with tabs across the top for each developer. 
- Prior to meeting, developers drag and drop tickets from their backlog to next sprint based on team priorities 

     - Developers are welcome at any time to discuss reassigning tickets with colleagues using common sense (if both are okay with the change, add "triage" tag to fix version with comment and triage team will review to make the change)
- During the meeting, developer's next sprint is reviewed, discussed, possibly adjusted and locked

Procedure: 

1. (Chair): Just prior to meeting, post **Hangout** link in `Standup private group <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/stand-up>`_
2. (Developer): Replies in Standup private group when sprint is ready for review

Triage Meeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Mattermost Inc-only** - (Triage team - 1-3 hours/week) Monday, Wednesday, Friday 09:00 UTC-7 

- Goal: To provide consistent review, prioritization and ownership assignment of all tickets 
- Attendees: (required) dev and PM from Mattermost Inc., typically leads (optional) other Mattermost Inc. colleagues welcome

Note: 

- ONLY TRIAGE TEAM should set or change the **Fix Verion** of a ticket. 

    - When tickets are first created, they go to triage to be reviewed for clarity and priority and assigned a **Fix Version**. Unclear tickets may be assigned to their creator for more information.
    - The **Fix Version** determines the sequence in which tickets are addressed and triage team is accountable for that sequence. 
    
- If you're ever unsure about a ticket (if it's not clear, or doesn't seem appropriate) add a comment and add **triage** to the **Fix Version** field, which will trigger a review by the triage team in 1-2 working days.  

    - It's the responsibility of the triage team to make sure tickets are clear before they're assigned a **Fix Version**.
    
- ONLY TRIAGE TEAM can close a ticket resolved as **Won't Fix** or **Won't do**

    - These tickets resolved in such a way are reviewed by triage team. 
    - Only resolve a ticket as **Won't Fix** or **Won't Do** if you're highly confident it's the correct decision, otherwise, add "triage" to Fix Version for review. In either case, include a comment with your reason.  

Procedure: 

1. (Chair): Just prior to meeting, post **Hangout** link in `Standup private group <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/stand-up>`_ (Mattermost Inc. only) 

2. (Attendees): Join the link 

3. (Attendees): Review `query for tickets needing triage <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-1203?filter=10105>`_ and assign owner and fix version

- Attendees: (required) dev, PM and community/marketing leads from Mattermost Inc. (optional) other Mattermost Inc. colleagues welcome

Note: 

- Decisions should go to Leads meetings when there is lack of clarify or ownership

    - When possible, decision-making should belong to the people closes to details
    - Individual developers or PMs should make most decisions, and raise to developer or PM team if things are unclear, and go to Leads if lack of clarify persists.
    
- To queue an item for Leads ask the dev or PM lead

    - Rather than randomize individual contributors, cross-discipline discussion (e.g. marketing to PM, community to dev, etc.) can happen in leads

Meeting Elements
-----------------------

Here we summarize meeting elements that can be re-used for meetings across teams. 

Warm-ups
~~~~~~~~

- 2-3 minute exercises designed to learn more a colleagues at the start of a recurring meeting
- Typically rotates alphabetically by first name, one colleague per meeting
- Examples: 

   - "Hobby talk" - sharing about an interesting hobby, past or present
   - "My home town" - sharing something interesting about where you grew up
   - "Two truths and a lie" - share two true facts about yourself and one lie, team guesses which is the lie. 

Open Questions 
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Exercise to find blindspots in team thinking at the end of a meeting
- Meeting does not end until 3 questions are asked and answered, typically at least one of the questions reveals a blindspot or opportunity to improve communication. 
- Examples of questions: 

    - "What's the status on X?" // often an important item that got forgotten
    - "Who owns X?" // reveals need for more clarity or communication 
    - "Why do we do X?" // let's us verify if a process is needed, and if we're handling it the right way
