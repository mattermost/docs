Meeting Elements
================

Here we summarize meeting elements that can be re-used for meetings across teams. 

Warm-ups
~~~~~~~~

- 2-3 minute exercises designed to learn more a colleagues at the start of a recurring meeting
- Typically rotates alphabetically by first name, one colleague per meeting
- Examples: 

   - "Hobby talk" - sharing about an interesting hobby, past or present
   - "My home town" - sharing something interesting about where you grew up
   - "Two truths and a lie" - share two true facts about yourself and one lie, team guesses which is the lie. 

Open Questions 
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Exercise to find blindspots in team thinking at the end of a meeting
- Meeting does not end until 3 questions are asked and answered, typically at least one of the questions reveals a blindspot or opportunity to improve communication. 
- Examples of questions: 

    - "What's the status on X?" // often an important item that got forgotten
    - "Who owns X?" // reveals need for more clarity or communication 
    - "Why do we do X?" // let's us verify if a process is needed, and if we're handling it the right way
