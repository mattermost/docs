Case Studies
=====================

This document outlines some of the procedures and materials in developing an effective case study for Mattermost software. This template can be used both to describe deployments of the open source Mattermost Team Edition or commercial deployments with Mattermost Enterprise Edition. We're delighted to hear everyone's story and to share it with the community. 

Case Study Process 
----------------------------

For Mattermost Enterprise Edition customers, Mattermost, Inc. is excited to bring attention to your company and how it's benefiting from using Mattermost. 

The process is approximately as follows: 

1. Customer has completed a deployment of Mattermost and is open to a case study. 
2. Customer case study contact is introduced to a Mattermost case study coordinator over email and completes a questionnaire (below). 
3. Mattermost case study coordinator arranges a 30-minute phone or video call with the customer for a discussion around the questionnaire and deployment. 
4. One to two weeks later a draft case study is sent to the customer for review and approval (in a shared Google document).
5. Mattermost case study coordinator and case study owner take turns to politely follow up with the customer either the day before the customer has stated that the review will be ready, in order to confirm that the review is coming, or approximately every 2 business days if an estimate of the draft case study review time is not known.

   -  In follow-up emails, it is important to take into consideration what can be done for the customer, rather than what the customer can do for us, e.g. "Circling back to see if there is anything I can do to help the case study review proceed more smoothly? Happy to help, just let me know."
   
6. Mattermost case study coordinator:

   -  Commissions a banner to be featured in the case study blog post. Please see "Marketing: Graphics" channel for examples on how to commission banners.
   -  Creates a draft blog post in WordPress. The draft is then reviewed for formatting, grammar, and other `style guidelines <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/marketing-guidelines.html>`_.

7. When the customer has completed a review of the draft case study and approved it, the customer feedback is incorporated into the draft blog post (in Wordpress).
8. A link to the final draft of the blog post is sent to the customer prior to publishing it (using preview mode in WordPress).
9. The blog post is then published and may be used in other marketing materials to share the benefits of a Mattermost solution with other potential customers.

Case Study Interview Process
---------------------------------------------

- The call will take place after the customer case study contact has completed the above questionnaire.
- The case study writer should also be on the call.
- At the beginning of the call, the customer is asked if they're in agreement that the interview be recorded to ensure accurate note-taking. Once agreed, the interview is then recorded via Zoom and the recording is transcribed after the call.
- A draft of the case study, in appropriate format, is sent to the customer for review 1-2 weeks after the call.

Written Case Study Lay Out
----------------------------

Follow these steps to write a case study that is clear and concise:

1. Title: Highlight the most compelling accomplishment.
2. Executive Summary: Begin the case study with a section that includes a powerful statement that catches the reader's attention and a summary of the most important points of the entire story.
3. About: Introduce the customer.
4. Challenges: Add a description of the challenges that the customer faced prior to using Mattermost. This section should also include goals the customer set out to achieve.
5. Solutions: Add a section that describes how Mattermost provided a solution to the customer's challenges.
6. Results: Add a testimonial that shows how Mattermost helped achieve the customer's goals. Include specific examples and quotations.

These Case Study procedures draw heavily from Hubspot's `How to Write a Case Study <https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33282/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-compelling-case-studies.aspx>`_ article.
