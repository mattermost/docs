Case Studies
=====================

This document outlines some of the procedures and materials in developing an effective case study for Mattermost software. This template can be used both to describe deployments of the open source Mattermost Team Edition or commercial deployments with Mattermost Enterprise Edition. We're delighted to hear everyone's story and to share it with the community. 

Customer Questionaire

The below customer questionaire template helps us gather information to share with the Mattermost community on your business, your needs, and how Mattermost can help serve your organization.  

We'd love your help answering some of these questions, either in email or over a phone call or video conference, to prepare a Case Study draft for your organization's review and approval.
