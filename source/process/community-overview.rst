Vision for Mattermost Community 
---------------------------------------------------------

Increase the popularity of Mattermost by increasing brand advocacy and meaningful product benefits that would otherwise not be offered, through an engaged and empowered contributor best practices, troubleshooting guidance, feature proposals, documentation, language translations, extensions, features and low priority bug fixes.

Principles
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Focus on areas with high impact-to-`mana <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#mana>`_ ratio.
2. It should be easy and straightforward to start contributing.
3. Community building should be directed towards 3R’s: Recognition, Retention and Recruitment.

Context 
---------------------------------------------------------

1. You need a community of users to attract a community of contributors. 
 
  - For every 10,000 users, 100 might file bugs or request features, 10 might read the contribution guidelines, 1 might submit a patch.

2. Expectations for contributors need to be realistic.

  - Contributing to open source is often a hobby or a side job. Expect the majority of contributors not to be experts. 

3. There are thousands of other open source projects.

  - It is very easy to leave to another project since there are many open source projects to choose from.

4. Community building is mana intensive.

  - You need to train contributors, developers and PMs to review PRs and create recognition programs that give specific roles to people.
