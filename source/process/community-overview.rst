Vision
---------------------------------------------------------

Increase popularity of Mattermost by empowering the community to have an impact by contributing features and extensions that would not otherwise be offered

Principles
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Focus on areas with high impact-to-mana ratio.
2. It should be easy and straightforward to start contributing.
3. Community building should be directed towards 3R’s: Recognition, Retention and Recruitment

Reality Check
---------------------------------------------------------

1. You cannot attract contributors without attracting users.
  
  - For every 1000 users, 100 file bugs, 10 submit a patch, 1 reads the contribution guidelines

2. Set realistic expectations to contributors.

  - Majority of contributors will not be experts. Also, contributing to open source is typically a hobby / side job.

3. There's thousands of other open source projects so it's very easy to leave to another project.

4. Community building is mana intensive.

  - You need to train contributors, dev and PM review PRs, and create recognition programs with specific roles to people.
