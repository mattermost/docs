Mattermost Community
============================================================

At Mattermost, we be believe workplace messaging will become a leading platform for workflow and business process. We believe building such a platform on open source infrastructure has powerful advantages.  

We consider people who share these beliefs, and who seek to benefit from or influence the Mattermost open source project, to be part of the "Mattermost Community". 

The success of Mattermost as an open source platform for messaging-based workflow and business process depends on empowering our community to build with us towards a shared vision. 

The Mattermost community has two parts, Users and Contributors, detailed below.

Users   
---------------------------------------------------------

In general, all members of the Mattermost community are users of the open source project. They may be end users on a system, administrators, or developers on the Mattermost platform in some way, and the common bond we all share is we benefit from the project's continued and growing success. 

The user community has a number of segments: 

End Users 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
People using Mattermost to communicate and achieve their organization's top priorities.

IT Administrators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People deploying Mattermost and supporting end users. 

System Integrators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People who extend and customize Mattermost privately but who do not share back their work with the open source community are considered "users". When the same people decide to share their work with others in the community they are recognized as "contributors"  

Customers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Organizations that purchase Mattermost Enterprise Edition as an extension of the Mattermost open source project for advanced features. While the Mattermost roadmap is focused on benefiting the broad community, large customers may accelerate certain parts of the roadmap they find most valuable through large purchases of Enterprise Edition licenses. 

Contributors  
---------------------------------------------------------

A subset of the Mattermost community as "contributors" who help increase the overall benefits of Mattermost for others. This may be as simple as offering feature ideas or reporting bugs, offering professional services to install or deploy the system, or it can be as involved as building whole new products based on Mattermost, or contributing code to the underlying software. 

The work of all contributors is valued, appreciated and recognized as a driving force behind the project's growth.  

There are many ways to contribute: 

Solution Contributors   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of July 2018, `over 1000 open source projects on GitHub reference Mattermost <https://github.com/search?q=mattermost>`__. Solution Builders create a host of technologies to empower Mattermost software to solve real world problems. Technologies include: 

- **Self-hosted Integration Solutions** - Includes connectivity and integration with 3rd party applications such as Jira, Confluence, GitLab, Jenkins and other tools 
- **SaaS-based Integration Solutions** - Includes connectivity and integration with services like Twitter, Zendesk, Salesforce and hundreds of other extensions with services like Zapier.
- **Programming Solutions** - Includes language-specific drivers and connectors to simplify the work of other developers 
- **Mattermost User Experience Plug-Ins** - Includes server and client-side plug-ins that enhance the native capabilities of a Mattermost server, such as voice, video and screensharing with Zoom's self-hosted or vendor-hosted solutions.  
- **Federated Experiences** - Includes bridges with IRC, Slack and other messaging applications through solutions like Matterbridge
- **Custom User Experiences** - Includes integrations into Terminal and Pidgin built off the same core APIs as Mattermost's Web, Desktop, iOS and Android experiences

Coordination Contributors 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coordination Contributors help organize and align contributors from all the different roles above. When coordinating and leading a contributor community, key principles to keep in mind include: 

1. Make it easy and realistic for contributors to get started. 

Have clear instructions and realistic expectations. Remember there are thousands of open source projects in the world so the more difficult it is to contribute the fewer contributions there will be. 

2. Recognize, retain and recruit

Recognizing people's contributions is vital to keeping them engaged. Leverage the existing programs to acknowledge the impact people are having. Retaining active contributors is hugely impactful because they're trained and ready to go on future projects, and both acknowledgement for jobs done well and new, interesting projects are key to keeping momentum going. The next more important is recruiting new contributors and being able to showcase a vibrant and active existing community to offer a model for new contributions. 

3. Focus on high impact, skill appropriate contributions 

When possible, influence contributors to apply themselves to the highest impact tickets and projects appropriate for their skill level. Meaningful contributions early in the contributor journey are a powerful way to draw people into the community. 

Mattermost Staff  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
