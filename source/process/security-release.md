# Security Release Process

If a security fix release is required, run through the below steps.

## Release Timeline

Notes:
- All cut-off dates are based on 10am ([San Francisco Time](http://everytimezone.com/)) on the day stated.
- T-minus counts are measured in "working days" (weekdays, Monday through Friday, excluding [the listed statutory holidays](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/working-at-mattermost.html#holidays)) prior to release day.

### A. (T-minus 4 working days) Code Complete

1. Release Manager:
    - Once the list of security issues to be fixed is finalized, post this checklist in Release Checklist channel
    - Notify community about upcoming security release through a Twitter announcement and in changelog with links to approved fixes and a date tagged as "TBD"
    - Email GitLab release team about upcoming security release
    - Work with a developer to submit GitLab MR [following this process](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/gitlab-process.html#merge-requests) and [test the upgrade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbeu2XXwCpbz3qz7y_6yDIYBToyY2nW0NFZq9Gdei1E/edit#heading=h.ncq9ltn04isg) once the GitLab MR is merged and included in their RC.
     - Open a ticket to [submit GitLab Omnibus RC install of Mattermost](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10365)
    -  Make a post in Announcements channel announcing the security release to the rest of the team with links to approved tickets and include a link to the ticket to submit the GitLab MR
2. Dev:
    - PRs for hotfixes are made to release branch
    - Review PRs made from release branch and merge changes into the release branch as required and merge the release branch back into master once per day

### B. (T-minus 3 working days) Release Candidate Cut

1. Build:
    - Verify with Release Manager before cutting any new dot release RCs (approved fixes should be merged)
    
### C. (T-minus 2 working days) Release Candidate Testing

1. QA:
    - If the dot release takes place during a regular release, update ``prev.test.mattermost.com`` to dot-release RCs for the previous release and keep ``rc.test.mattermost.com`` on the latest regular release version
    - Test the new RC to verify fixes merged to the release branch work
    - Post in Release Discussion channel after testing
2. Logistics:
    - If the security researcher has not previously received a security researcher mug, order one for them 

### D. (T-minus 0 working days) Release Build Cut

Once security fix release is ready to cut:

1. Dev:
    - Tag a new release (e.g., 1.1.1) and run an official build
