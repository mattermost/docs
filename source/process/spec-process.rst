Spec Review Process
===================

This is a rough guideline for drafting and reviewing specs. It’s meant to be used as a starting point, and not all specs will follow this exact process - please rely on your judgment, as not all steps may apply.

1. **Brainstorm / research.**

    - Research topic
    - Research customer requirements
    - Pair design brainstorm
    - User workflows
    - Consider options / vision for UI
    
2. **Initial draft.**

    - Goal / “Why"
    
      - Link to customer data / feedback
      - Link back to company objectives
      
    - User Stories
    - Rough and Quick Wireframes / Mock ups
    
      - Flows of screens
      - Focus should be on the mock ups, with text that supports design
      
    - Questions that still need to be addressed
    - What is “Not in scope” for the spec (things that are purposefully left out, to be addressed at another time)
    - Success Metrics
    - Pair reviews
    
      - Iterate on designs as needed
      - Early meetings with developers to discuss the design, and identify any potential issues
      
3. **Share with team.**

    - Post draft with @channel in Spec Review channel, asking to review and add comments
    
4. **Initial spec review.**

    - Schedule a meeting with interested people to discuss comments and any other questions about the spec, try to include at least one member from each of the following teams:
    
      - UX Design
      - PM
      - Dev
      - Test
      
5. **Update draft.**

    - Update based on feedback, including wireframes / mock ups
    
6. **Additional reviews.**

    - Post updated draft in Spec Review channel, asking the people who previously commented for another review
    - Share with interested customers for feedback when the spec is at an appropriate point
    - Repeat reviews / updates as needed until final draft is signed off on by UX Design, PM, Dev, Test
    
7. **Break into tickets.**

    - Dev breaks the spec into tickets, and reviews with PM so everyone is on the same page about the plan
