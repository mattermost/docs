Documentation Guidelines
========================

This is the Mattermost style guide for documentation. It acts as a reference for writers and editors to ensure that the Mattermost documentation is consistent and clear.

.. Note::
  The style guide is not intended to slow down or otherwise impede contributions, which are always welcome. No contribution will be rejected due to non-conforming style, although it might be edited.
