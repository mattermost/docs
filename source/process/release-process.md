# Release Process

Mattermost core team works on a monthly release process, with a new version shipping on the 16th of each month in [binary form](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#mattermost-team-edition). 

This document outlines the development process for the Mattermost core team, which draws from what we find works best for us from Agile, Scrum and Software Development Lifecycle approaches.

## Release Timeline

Notes: 
- All cut-off dates are based on 10am PST (UTC-07/08) on the day stated. 
- T-minus counts are measured in "working days" (weekdays other than major holidays concurrent in US and Canada) prior to release day.

### A. (Code complete date of previous release) Beginning of release

Pre-work for the current release begins at the code complete date of the previous release. See "Code Complete" section below for details.

### B. (T-minus 10 working days) Cut-off for major features

No pull requests for major features should be submitted to the current release after this date (except if release manager decides to add "release-exception" label to Jira ticket).
