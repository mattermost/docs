Our Leadership Principles
-------------------------

Leadership principles are deliberate choices defining our behavior. When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our principles:

- **Customer Obsession** - We exist to make customers successful. In everything we do, start with customer perspective and work backwards. Earn and keep their trust.

- **Ownership** - Own the outcomes of your activity. Don't drop the ball. When we see a vacuum on something important, we jump in - we never say "it's not my job."

- **High Impact** - Figure out what matters most, and focus on those priorities. When deciding to work on low impact or high impact projects, choose high impact.

- **Self-Awareness** - We understand and seek to understand our strengths and growth opportunities, as individuals and organizations. We are open to critique and share critique constructively and respectfully. 

- **Be proud of what you build** - Insist on high standards. Ensure that you're building the highest quality products, services, and processes possible, and constantly raising the bar.
