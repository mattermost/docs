Mindsets
============

Mindsets are "tool sets for the mind" that help us find blind spots and increase performance in specific situations. They're a reflection of our shared learnings and culture in the Mattermost community and at Mattermost Inc. 

To make the most out of mindsets, remember: 

- **Mindsets are tools** - Use common sense to find the right mindset for your situation. Avoid using ones that don't fit. 
- **Mindsets are temporary** - Try on a mindset the way you'd try a tool. You can always put it down if it doesn't work. 
- **Mindsets are not laws** - Mindsets are situation-specific, not universal. Don't use them to debate. 

When you read about great leaders, they share mindsets relevant to success in their specific situations, which differ from their peers. Remember that "advice is personal experience generalized" so be mindful about what you apply. 

In this context, here are mindsets for Mattermost: 

Learn, Master, Teach 
~~~~~

**Learn** a new topic quickly, develop **mastery** (be the smartest person at the team/company/community on the topic), then **teach** it to someone who will start the cycle over. 

If you're a strong teacher, their mastery should surpass yours. This mindset helps us constantly grow and rotate into new roles, while preventing "single-points of failure" where only one person is qualified for a certain task. 

Slow is smooth, smooth is fast 
~~~~~

When you rush to get something done quickly, it can actually increase the time and cost for the project. 

Rushing means a higher chance of missing things that need to be done, and the cost of doing them later is significantly higher because you have to re-create your original setup to add on the work.
