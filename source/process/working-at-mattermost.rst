Working Remotely 
----------------------------------------------------------

We're headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and like many open source companies a large portion of Mattermost, Inc. works remotely from around the world. 

This gives us tremendous advantages: 

1. **Access to top talent.** We can hire from anywhere.
2. **More comfort.** People have 100% control of their surroundings. 
3. **No commute.** Removing a 30-60 minute commute saves 250-500 hours a year. 
4. **Time zone coverage.** Support customers with team members near their timezone. 
5. **Output-focused culture.** Results matter more than hours at a desk. 

You may be asked to travel two or three times a year for in-person "offsites" with the team, each trip being about a week long. 

Outside of those trips, we run as a distributed, high performance team using a few principles: 

1) Work from anywhere with good Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Working from anywhere means more time with loved ones, no commute, and controlling everything about your workspace. 

The one requirement is having a strong internet connection for occassional video or audio conferences. Ethernet connections are preferred over Wifi, since Wifi can have interference. 

2) Be explicit 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you send a message, you take someone's full attention, so get across the relevant information as soon as you can.

Don't say "Are you free to talk?", instead say "Catch up on ulimit issue Customer X is having?"

Likewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time. 

3) Follow through 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When working on problems, make sure to be clear about next steps, and either follow through or create a ticket to track the work. 

4) Hang out 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have `warm-ups <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/meetings.html#warm-ups>`_ in some meetings to learn more about each other. It's part of a culture where we get to know each other. 

Find time after meetings and video conferences to get to know your teammates. Ask them about their weekends and how their life is outside of work.

When you meet in person at off-sites and events, build on those relationships.  

5) Be the change you want to see
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When something's not clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what's going on and update the documentation for the people who come after you. 

`Learn, Master, Teach <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/mindsets.html#learn-master-teach>`_ is a model we use to pass on training after you've been trained to help grow everyone at the company.
