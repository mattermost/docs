Work Anywhere 
----------------------------------------------------------

We're headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and like many open source companies a large portion of Mattermost, Inc. works from anywhere in the world.

This gives us tremendous advantages:

1. **Access to top talent.** We can hire from anywhere.
2. **More comfort.** People have 100% control of their surroundings.
3. **No commute.** Removing a 30-60 minute commute saves 250-500 hours a year.
4. **Time zone coverage.** We can more easily support global customers.
5. **Results-focused culture.** Output matters more than hours at a desk.

Also, we have Meetups around the world to deepen and broaden our relationships and build the future of our products together:

* Check out `MatterCon 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXaYttz3NA&feature=youtu.be>`__.
* Watch highlights of `our Community Meetup in Toronto, Canada <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c9oJdbXrMU>`__.
* See `our Core Commiter Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RpmrM-5UFY>`__.

We run as a distributed, high performance team using a few principles:

1) Work Anywhere with Good Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Working from anywhere means more time with loved ones, no commute and controlling everything about your workspace. 

The one requirement is having the ability to occasionally `join video calls using Zoom <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux>`__ between 8am and 1pm California time, which requires a good enough internet connection.

Recommended download/upload speeds should be 8 Mbps/512 kbps for smooth group calling and screensharing, with a bare minimum of 4 Mbps/128 kbps. The `CRS Video Conference Bandwidth Speed Tool <http://speed.conferenceroomsystems.com/>`__ can be used to check your internet speed.

There are exceptions to this requirement, for example: part-time roles that don't need to take meetings, or roles providing support outside core meeting hours.

2) Be Explicit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Working in a distributed organization means it may take time before a person reads your message and responds, so make sure you are clear. 

Communicate relevant information in the first message:

- Avoid "Are you free to talk?" and "`Can we talk about something at 3pm? <https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/jobs/when-youre-in-charge-your-whisper-may-feel-like-a-shout.html?_r=0>`__", instead use "Can we speak about ulimit issue Customer X is having?"

Write unambiguously:

- Avoid "I think the answer is Yes", instead use "Yes", "No", or "I think the answer is Yes, I'll confirm with Steve and let you know."

Likewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time.

3) Follow Through
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When working on problems, make sure to be clear about next steps, and either follow through or create a ticket to track the work.

4) Hang Out
~~~~~~~~~~~
We have `warm-ups <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#warm-ups>`__ in some meetings to learn more about each other. It's part of a culture where we get to know each other.

Find time after meetings and video conferences to get to know your teammates. Ask them about their weekends and how their life is outside of work.

When you meet in person at off-sites and events, build on those relationships.

5) Be the Change You Want to See
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When something's not clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what's going on and update the documentation for the people who come after you.

`Learn, Master, Teach <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#learn-master-teach>`__ is a model we use to pass on training after you've been trained to help grow everyone at the company.


-------------
Paid Time Off
-------------

1) Time Off
~~~~~~~~~~~

Our culture is high trust and results-focused. We want people to take time away to relax, think and come back energized. 

When you take time off, please remember:

a) Discuss with your manager the dates you plan to take off, and decide who will be your backup.

b) For meetings you'll miss, message the chair with any status updates.

c) Post in the `Stand-up channel <https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up>`__ the dates you'll be away and who'll be your backup. 

d) Block off time in the shared `Mattermost Timeoff calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mattermost.com_mg3nulgf6e70e50ohlq2rrkcnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>`__, so it's easy for the team to see who is going to be away.

There is no limit to how much time-off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of two weeks per year.

2) Holidays
~~~~~~~~~~~

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, region/country and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time off process in 1) above.

We're headquartered in the US and have a large Canadian contingent, so below are holidays we're expecting people from those countries to take off:

US and Canadian Holidays for 2020:

- New Year's Day (1/1/2020)
- US MLK Jr. Day (1/20/2020)
- Canadian Family Day and US Presidents' Day (2/17/2020)
- US and Canadian Good Friday (4/10/2020)
- Canadian Victoria Day (5/18/2020)
- US Memorial Day (5/25/2020)
- Canada Day (7/1/2020)

- US Thanksgiving (11/26/2020)
- US and Canadian Christmas Day (12/25/2020)
- Canadian Boxing Day (12/26/2020++)

It's up to meeting chairs to decide whether to reschedule if few people can attend (e.g. if there are a lot of US or Canadians in the meeting).

+July 4, 2020 (the legal public holiday for US Independence Day), falls on a Saturday. For staff, Friday, July 3, may be treated as a holiday.

++December 26, 2020 falls on a Saturday.

3) On-call Rotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have an "on-call" schedule for key staff to support customer escalations and for sales. Should your on-call schedule fall on a holiday or during time off, you can trade with teammates of similar qualification, or if you are called in because you are on-call during a holiday, you're encouraged to take time off on a non-holiday in exchange.

MatterCon 
---------

MatterCon is an annual conference for Mattermosters and the contributor community to come together. In 2018, it was held in Lisbon, Portugal. In 2019, in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. In 2020, it was held in Nassau, Bahamas.

It's a time for Mattermosters and top contributors from our community to get together, to celebrate our achievements and to build shared experiences and empathy to increase the efficiency of working together. 

Traditions
~~~~~~~~~~

During one night of the meet up, teams get together for a dinner and afterwards there is an option to play a round of "hot seat". In hot seat one person volunteers to receive feedback from the rest of the group - one "like" (something they do well) and one "wish" (an opportunity to improve). After everyone has shared feedback, the volunteer has the option of making a commitment to the group on making a change in how they work and to ask the group's help to share feedback on the change and keep them accountable.
