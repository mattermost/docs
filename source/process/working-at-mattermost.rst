Working Remotely 
----------------------------------------------------------

We're headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and like many open source companies a large portion of Mattermost, Inc. works remotely from around the world. 

This gives us tremendous advantages: 

1. **Access to top talent.** We can hire from anywhere.
2. **More comfort.** People have 100% control of their surroundings. 
3. **No commute.** Removing a 30-60 minute commute saves 250-500 hours a year. 
4. **Time zone coverage.** We can more easily support global customers. 
5. **Results-focused culture.** Output matters more than hours at a desk. 

We run as a distributed, high performance team using a few principles: 

1) Work from anywhere with good Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Working from anywhere means more time with loved ones, no commute, and controlling everything about your workspace. 

The one requirement is having a strong internet connection for occassional video or audio conferences. Ethernet connections are preferred over Wifi, since Wifi can have interference. 

2) Be explicit 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Working remote means it may take time before a person reads your message and responds, so make sure you are clear. 

Communicate relevant information in the first message: 

- Avoid "Are you free to talk?" and "`Can we talk about something at 3pm? <https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/jobs/when-youre-in-charge-your-whisper-may-feel-like-a-shout.html?_r=0>`_", instead use "Can we speak about ulimit issue Customer X is having?"

Write unambiguously: 

- Avoid "I think the answer is Yes", instead use "Yes", "No", or "I think the answer is Yes, I'll confirm with Steve and let you know." 

Likewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time. 

3) Follow through 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When working on problems, make sure to be clear about next steps, and either follow through or create a ticket to track the work. 

4) Hang out 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have `warm-ups <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/meetings.html#warm-ups>`_ in some meetings to learn more about each other. It's part of a culture where we get to know each other. 

Find time after meetings and video conferences to get to know your teammates. Ask them about their weekends and how their life is outside of work.

When you meet in person at off-sites and events, build on those relationships.  

5) Be the change you want to see
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When something's not clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what's going on and update the documentation for the people who come after you. 

`Learn, Master, Teach <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/mindsets.html#learn-master-teach>`_ is a model we use to pass on training after you've been trained to help grow everyone at the company. 


----------------------------------------------------------
Paid Time Off 
----------------------------------------------------------

1) Time-off
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our culture is high trust and results-focused. No need to ask anyone when you plan to be away, just plan ahead and let teammates know in advance. 

When you take time-off, please remember: 

a) Block off time on your calendar so it's easy to see when you're away. 

b) For meetings you'll miss, message the chair with any status update. 

c) Post in the Standup channel dates you're away and who'll be your backup 

There is no limit to how much time-off you can take. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year. 

2) Holidays 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident country and preferences. Please just follow the TIME OFF process in 1) above. 

We're headquartered in the US and have a large Canadian contingent, so below are holidays we're expecting people from those countries to take off:

US & Canadian Holidays remaining for 2016: 

- US & Canadian Christmas Day (12/25/2016)
- Canadian Boxing Day (12/26/2016)

- Canadian Boxing Day (12/26/2017)

It's up to meeting chairs to decide whether to reschedule if few people can attend (e.g. if there are a lot of US or Canadians in the meeting). 

3) On-call rotations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have an "On-call" schedule for key staff to support customer escalations and for sales. Should your on-call schedule fall on a holiday or during time-off, you can trade with teammates of similar qualification, or if you are called in because you are on-call during a holiday, you're encouraged to take time-off on a non-holiday in exchange.
