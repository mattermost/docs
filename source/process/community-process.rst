Community Monitoring Process
============================

This document outlines the process for monitoring and responding to community questions in various channels.

Community Product Manager
--------------------------

Every week, we rotate which PM is responsible for making sure community questions get answered. We rotate alphabetically (for example, Eric -> Jason -> Lindsay).

When responding to issues:

1. Identify what type of post it is:

  - Troubleshooting
  - Feature Proposal
  - Bug
  - Developer/Product Question

2. Ask questions to narrow down or understand the issue better:

  - Try to understand the issue yourself as much as possible first
  - If appropriate, ask a developer for assistance on technical questions

3. Respond:

  - Include a link to related documentation in your response (eg Jira ticket, feature proposal, etc.)
  - If there is no related documentation, write the documentation and include the link in your response:

    - For reproducible bugs, create a Jira ticket
    - For product questions or troubleshooting, update docs.mattermost.com if appropriate
    - For feature proposals, ask them to `create a feature proposal <https://www.mattermost.org/feature-ideas/>`_ and post the link back

  - If appropriate, ask if the community member would be interested in contributing the feature / bug fix


Community channels
------------------

The various community channels are outlined below, along with the responsibilities of the Ops Team and the PM on community rotation. Generally the Ops Team helps with notifying team members about issues in need of a response, and the Community PM coordinates to make sure the responses are made.

        - Troubleshooting: Request to move to forums
        - Feature Proposal: Request to move to feature idea forums

    - Ops posts [Help Wanted] #forum @here can anyone help with these forum questions? These forum posts are open to everyone in the community. If you find something you think you know the answer to or can help with, please help post a response and be part of creating a vibrant Mattermost community!" with a list that includes:
