Community Monitoring Process
============================

This document outlines the process for monitoring and responding to community questions in various channels.

Community Manager
-----------------

When responding to issues:

1. Identify what type of post it is:

  - Troubleshooting
  - Feature Proposal
  - Bug
  - Developer/Product Question

2. Ask questions to narrow down or understand the issue better:

  - Try to understand the issue yourself as much as possible first
  - If appropriate, ask a developer for assistance on technical questions

3. Respond:

  - Include a link to related documentation in your response (e.g. Jira ticket, feature proposal, etc.)
  - If there is no related documentation, write the documentation and include the link in your response:

    - For reproducible bugs, create a Jira ticket
    - For product questions or troubleshooting, update docs.mattermost.com if appropriate
    - For feature proposals, ask them to `create a feature proposal <https://www.mattermost.org/feature-ideas/>`_ and post the link back

  - If appropriate, ask if the community member would be interested in contributing the feature / bug fix


Community channels
------------------

The various community channels are outlined below. On a daily basis, the Community Manager helps with notifying team members about issues in need of a response and, if necessary, asks for help from a developer.

1. `Peer-to-peer Help Channel <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/peer-to-peer-help>`_: Forum Issues / GitLab / Stack Overflow

  - Description:

    - Community Manager reviews new `GitHub mattermost/mattermost-server <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server>`_ and `GitHub mattermost/mattermost-mobile <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/issues>`_ issues daily, and responds to all new issues:

        - Bug Report: Try to reproduce, or ask another team member to reproduce
        - Troubleshooting: Request to move to forums
        - Feature Proposal: Request to move to feature idea forums

    - Community Manager posts "[Help Wanted] #forum #github @here @[dev on rotation] These forum posts are open to everyone in the community. If you find something you think you know the answer to or can help with, please help post a response and be part of creating a vibrant Mattermost community!" with a list that includes:

      - Forum and `GitHub mattermost/mattermost-server <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server>`_ posts that are >=2 days old (this gives community members a chance to respond first)
      - New forum posts referencing Enterprise features or upgrade issues after a release
      - Forum posts with a new reply to questions asked by the core team

    - Everyone from the team/community can step in and answer forum posts

  - Community Manager Responsibility:

    - Review the list for posts that haven’t been answered, and either reply (with help from dev if needed) or route to the appropriate person, following up to make sure a response is posted
    
2. `Peer-to-peer Help Channel <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/peer-to-peer-help>`_: UserVoice Issues

  - Description:

    - Ops Team @mentions the Community PM with a list that includes issues:

      - where status requires updating
      
        - Under Review: After a ticket is created but the spec is not yet complete
        - Planned: Jira ticket with a plan on how to build the feature
        - Started: When a developer has begun to work on the Jira ticket (the ticket shows that it is in progress)
        - Help Wanted: Ticket that is open to any contributor wanting to work on the issue
        - Completed: When ticket is resolved
        - Declined: When the suggestion does not fit with the `product vision <https://www.mattermost.org/manifesto/>`_
        
      - where a PM might want to ask a question for clarification or ideas on how to design something
      - where the requester specifies they want to work on the feature
      
    - Community PM Responsibility - Team Edition:
    
      - The PM who is release manager for the current release cycle will update the issues after release date.
