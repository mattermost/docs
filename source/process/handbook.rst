Mission 
------------------------------------------

Our mission is to give every organization the power to achieve their highest priorities through modern communication.

Our vision is a world more connected to what matters most.

Values
------------------------------------------

Values are deliberate choices defining our behavior. When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values: 

Customer Obsession 
====================================
We exist to make customers successful. In everything we do, start with customer perspective and work backwards. Earn and keep their trust. 

Ownership 
====================================
Own the outcomes of your activity. Don't drop the ball. When we see a vacuum on something important, we jump in--we never say "it's not my job." 

High Impact 
====================================
Figure out what matters most, and focus on those priorities. When deciding to work on low impact or high impact projects, choose high impact. 

Be proud of what you build
====================================
Insist on high standards. Ensure that you're building the highest quality products, services, and processes possible, and constantly raising the bar.
