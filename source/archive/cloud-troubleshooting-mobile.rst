Troubleshooting Mobile Applications
===================================

Login with ADFS/Office365 is not working
----------------------------------------

In line with Microsoft guidance we recommend `configuring intranet forms-based authentication for devices that do not support WIA <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-intranet-forms-based-authentication-for-devices-that-do-not-support-wia>`_.

I have a different problem!

For more troubleshooting help, `open a new topic in our forums <https://forum.mattermost.org/c/trouble-shoot>`__ with steps to reproduce your issue. If you're a Cloud subscriber, you may reach our Support team via our `Contact Us page <https://customers.mattermost.com/cloud/contact-us>`_.

To help us narrow down whether it’s a server configuration issue, device specific issue, or an issue with the app please try the following steps and include the results in your support request:

**Connect to our community workspace**

1. Create an account at https://community.mattermost.com.
2. Delete your mobile application and reinstall it.
3. In your mobile app, enter the server URL https://community.mattermost.com and then your login credentials to see if the connection is working.

**Connect with another device**

- If you have another mobile device available, try connecting with that to see if your issue still reproduces.
- If you don’t have another device available, check with other teammates to see if they are having the same issue.
