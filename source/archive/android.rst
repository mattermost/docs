The Mattermost Android app lets you connect to your Mattermost server and switch among teams. You can also receive push notifications on mentions in Mattermost when your mobile app is closed or running in the background. 

Getting Started 
---------------

1. Download the `Mattermost Android app from Google Play. <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattermost.mattermost&hl=en>`__
2. Open the app and enter the web address of your server (for example: https://mattermost.company.com).
3. When you see the login page, log in as you would on your desktop.
4. Select a team to enter, join a team, or create a new team.

The above instructions are for Mattermost 3.0 and later. If you're running on Mattermost 2.x, you can `download the Android 2.x application file <https://releases.mattermost.com/client-android/mattermost-android-2.1.0.apk>`__ to install manually until your server is upgraded to 3.0.
