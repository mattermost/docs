Mattermost Cloud Enterprise
---------------------------

Mattermost Cloud Enterprise offers the isolation, security, and control of self-hosted editions but without the burden of managing deployment, maintaining uptime, or applying upgrades. Mattermost Cloud Enterprise offers all chat and administration features, integrated DevOps workflows, and enterprise-grade support.
  
Every Mattermost Cloud Enterprise instance is deployed in a private environment within an AWS VPC dedicated to a single customer. Within that VPC, all the required resources to run, monitor, and administer Mattermost are deployed in isolation. These resources include a dedicated RDS Aurora database cluster and a dedicated Kubernetes cluster, deployed across multiple Availability Zones and managed by Kubernetes experts.

This intentional isolation and dedicated deployment supports other privacy-centric features, such as VPC Peering, bring-your-own-domain and certificates, mutual TLS, access to monitoring tools, databases to run custom analysis, and more.

Future releases will include an enterprise network integration with VPC Peering, TLS mutual authentication, and additional data residency options.

How is customer data in Mattermost Cloud Enterprise encrypted?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost uses AWS-provided functionality to enable encryption-at-rest for both databases and file stores. See `Encrypting Amazon RDS resources - Amazon Relational Database Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html>`__ and `Protecting data using server-side encryption - Amazon Simple Storage Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ for details. 

Whether customer data should be stored in Mattermost Cloud depends heavily on the nature of the data and compliance requirements. We recommend that customers set up their own internal policies or controls around what can and cannot be put into Mattermost.

Are S3-managed keys used for server-side encryption? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Customer-provided keys may be considered for a future release.
