# Deprecated content

The files in this folder have, for the most part, been moved to other parts of the Documentation site - or to developers.mattermost.com. However, you can still contribute to the content! Visit [developers.mattermost.com](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/getting-started/) to find the relevant document and submit a PR. If you can't find the **Edit on GitHub** option on the page, please note that this is a bug that's being attended to by Gitbook. In the meantime, you can edit pages directly in the repo, which you can find at [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation).

Questions? Issues? Get hold of the Documentation Team in the [DWG channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group).

Thank you!
