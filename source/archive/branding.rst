Mattermost Visual Design Guidelines
--------------------------------------

Mattermost Logo
-------------------------------

For details on Mattermost logo usage guidelines please visit: https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/brand-and-visual-design-guidelines

Mattermost User Experience
-------------------------------

For details on the visual design of the Mattermost user experience, please see: https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/fx-guidelines.html.

Naming Usage Guidelines
-------------------------------

Using the Mattermost name is generally fine so long as it’s used in a non-commercial way and does not imply endorsement by Mattermost, Inc.

Naming Integrations
-------------------------------

The following guidelines are intended to help developers of Mattermost integrations offer clear, consistent naming across the broader community.

- IMPORTANT: Please do not start with or use the name "Mattermost" for your integration as this may confuse  users on where to find support.

Community projects may be named using “for Mattermost”, for example:

- `GitLab Integration Service for Mattermost <https://github.com/NotSqrt/mattermost-integration-gitlab>`__
- `Giphy Integration Service for Mattermost <https://github.com/numberly/mattermost-integration-giphy>`__

Alternatively, community projects may concatenate names containing Mattermost, for example:

- `Matterbridge <https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge>`__ – is a Mattermost bridge connecting with IRC
- `Mattersend <https://github.com/mtorromeo/mattersend>`__ – is a Mattermost integration for sending webhook events

Exception: Please don’t use the name “matterbot”, as that is an internal service under development.

When there are multiple open source projects for similar Mattermost integrations we ask our community to include the owner of the repo, for example:

- `Hubot Adapter for Mattermost by Heitor Lessa <https://github.com/renanvicente/hubot-mattermost>`__
- `Hubot Adapter for Mattermost by Andy Lo-A-Foe <https://github.com/loafoe/hubot-matteruser>`__

Product Description
-------------------------------

Below are optional product descriptions that can be used when referring to Mattermost from other open source projects or commercial 3rd party integrations.
