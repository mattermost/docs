Slash commands perform operations in Mattermost by typing into the text input box. Enter a ``/`` followed by a command and some arguments to perform actions.

Built-in slash commands come with all Mattermost installations and custom slash commands are configurable to interact with external applications. Learn about configuring custom slash commands on the `developer slash command documentation page <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/other-integrations/slash-commands/>`__.

.. note::
  Custom status slash commands marked with an asterisk (*) in the table above will be available in the Mattermost Mobile App in a future release.

Custom Commands
---------------

Custom slash commands integrate with external applications. For example, a team might configure a custom slash command to check internal health records with `/patient joe smith` or check the weekly weather forecast in a city with `/weather toronto week`. Check with your System Admin or open the autocomplete list by typing `/` to determine if your team configured any custom slash commands.

Custom slash commands are disabled by default and can be enabled by the System Admin by going to **System Console** > **Integrations** > **Integration Management**. Learn about configuring custom slash commands on the `developer slash command documentation page <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/other-integrations/slash-commands/>`__.
