Let your team know whether you're available by setting a custom status and your availability in Mattermost.

Setting a Custom Status
-----------------------

Set a custom status to add an optional emoji to a descriptive status message. Other members can see your status anywhere they can see your name, such as the channel sidebar and in conversations.Â 

1. To set a custom status, select your avatar at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Set a Custom Status**.

2. Choose from a list of suggested statuses, reuse a recent status, or enter a new emoji and status, then select **Set Status**. The Speech bubble emoji ðŸ’¬  is used by default if you don't specify an emoji. A custom status can be a maximum of 100 characters in length.

.. note::

  - If custom statuses aren't available, you can request your System Admin to enable this feature in **System Console > Site Configuration > Users and Teams > Enable Custom Statuses**.
  - Custom statuses will be available in the Mattermost Mobile App in a future release. 

Clearing a Custom Status
------------------------

New custom statuses display until midnight the day they're set by default. You can configure a custom status to clear after a preferred period of time, clear at a specific date and time, or to continue to display until manually cleared.

To manually clear a custom status at any time, select your avatar at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Clear Status**, or select the **Clear** option next to your current status.

Setting Your Availability
-------------------------

To set your availability, select your avatar, then specify your availability as  **Online**,Â **Away**,Â **Do Not Disturb**, orÂ **Offline**.

When you set your availability, an availability icon displays next to your name. Setting your availability as **Do Not Disturb**Â automatically disables desktop, email, and push notifications.

Other members can see your availability anywhere they can see your name, such as the channel sidebar, within conversations, and within Direct Messages.Â
