Troubleshooting/FAQ
-------------------

I see an error: "Not enough data for a meaningful representation"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the statistics page is loading endlessly and you get an error message saying "Not enough data for a meaningful representation", check whether you're using an ad blocker. An ad blocker can prevent this page from loading data. To test this, temporarily disable your ad blocker, or view the page in a browser without an ad blocker installed.

Can Team Admins review their own team's statistics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System Admins can designate the **Viewer** `System Admin Role </onboard/system-admin-roles.html>`__ to enable Team Admin to see team statistics.

Once Team Admins are assigned to the **Viewer** role, they can access all statistics for all teams.

System Admins must then `edit the privileges </onboard/system-admin-roles.html#editing-privileges-of-admin-roles-advanced>`__ of the **Viewer** role. Only the **Reporting** privileges need to be enabled to allow Team Admins to see statistics for their teams.

Once the **Viewer** role is set up for reporting access only, System Admins can then `assign </onboard/system-admin-roles.html#assigning-admin-roles>`__ the **Viewer** role to Team Admins.

.. note::
  - System Admins must manually add or remove members from the **Viewer** role to address Team Admin changes, such as promotions or demotions.
  - Team Admins using the **Viewer** role will also have access to system level statistics in addition to statistics for their teams.
