Channels are where you can communicate with your team about various topics or projects. The channels you're a member of and useful channel management tools are available in the channel sidebar to the left. 

See our `Mattermost Channels </guides/channels.html>`__ documentation for details on the many ways you can use Channels to enable team collaboration.

Channels, messages, and conversations
-------------------------------------



Create and join channels
------------------------

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a **Globe** |globe| icon. Anyone on the team can join a public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are identified with a **Lock** |lock| icon. You must be invited to private channels by another channel member.

As your channel sidebar fills up with channels you've joined, you can organize your channels into categories based on how you work. See the `customize your channel sidebar </channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ documentation for details.

Invite people to the team
-------------------------

You can invite members of your organization, as well as external guests such as vendors or project partners, to a Mattermost team. Anyone can invite people to the team, unless the system admin has `disabled this option </configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-account-creation>`__ or `restricted permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__ to do so. See the `about teams </welcome/about-teams.html>`__ documentation to learn more about team invitations.
