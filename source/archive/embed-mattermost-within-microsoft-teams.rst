Using the `Mattermost for Microsoft Teams </about/mattermost-for-microsoft-teams.html>`__ integration, you can choose to embed your Mattermost workspace within your Microsoft Teams instance and take advantage of `embedded app features <about/mattermost-for-microsoft-teams.html#benefits-of-embedding-mattermost>`__.

.. important::

    You must `install the Mattermost for Microsoft Teams integration </about/install-mattermost-for-microsoft-teams-plugin.html>`__ before you can embed the Mattermost app within Microsoft Teams.

To embed the Mattermost app within Microsoft Teams:

1. In Mattermost, as an administrator, go to **System Console > Plugins > MSTeams Sync**. At the bottom of the settings page, select **Download Manifest** to download a ZIP file containing the Microsoft Teams application manifest pre-configured for your Mattermost workspace.
2. In Microsoft Teams, as an administrator, go to the Microsoft Teams admin center under **Teams Apps > Manage Apps**, or use the following URL: ``https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps``.
3. Select **Upload new app**, then upload the app manifest you downloaded in the previous step.

Youâ€™re all set! The Mattermost app is now available to everyone in your Microsoft Teams workspace.

------------------------------------------

1. Add the Mattermost app by selecting **Apps** within the left-hand sidebar, select **Add** located next to the Mattermost for Microsoft Teams app, then select **Add** again. Once added, your Mattermost workspace is now embedded in your Microsoft Teams instance. 
2. Pin the Mattermost app in your left-hand sidebar, to access it easily in the future, by right-clicking the Mattermost tab and selecting **Pin**.
