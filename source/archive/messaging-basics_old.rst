Messaging Basics
================

**Write messages** using the text input box at the bottom of the screen. Press ENTER to send a message. Use SHIFT+ENTER to create a new line without sending a message. To send messages on CTRL+ENTER and use ENTER to insert new lines go to **Main Menu > Account Settings > Advanced** > **Send messages on CTRL+ENTER**.


**Reply to messages** by clicking the reply arrow next to the message text.

**Notify teammates** when they are needed by typing ``@username``.

**Format your messages** using Markdown that supports text styling, headings, links, emojis, code blocks, block quotes, tables, lists, and in-line images.

You can use either ``_`` or ``*`` for italics and bold text. See the table below for examples.

**Quickly add emojis** by typing ":" followed by two characters, which will open an emoji autocomplete. If the existing emojis don't cover what you want to express, you can also create your own `Custom Emoji </help/settings/custom-emoji.html>`__.

**Attach files** by dragging and dropping them into Mattermost or clicking the attachment icon in the text input box.

**Save messages for follow up** using the **Save** icon next to the message.
