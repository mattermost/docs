Selecting recent emojis
-----------------------

From Mattermost v6.1 and in Mattermost Cloud, react to messages quickly by selecting a recently-used emoji while hovering over a message. If your most recent reactions aren't visible, you can enable quick reactions by selecting **Settings > Display > Quick reactions on messages**.

Typing an emoji

Alternatively, open the emoji autocomplete by typing ``:`` followed by at least two characters of the word describing the emoji. Descriptions include skin tone details for people-based emojis, where supported.

It's also possible to `create your own custom emoji <#custom-emoji>`_ if the emoji you want to use doesn't exist.

Creating Custom Emojis
-----------------------
  
You can create Custom Emojis which are available to everyone on your Mattermost server. From the Emoji Picker, select **Custom Emoji**. Small, square pictures work best when selecting an image to upload. The file can be any JPG, GIF, or PNG and up to 1 MB in size.
  
1. Enter a name for your Custom Emoji. This is the name that will show up in the emoji autocomplete.
2. Choose **Select**, then select the image to use for the emoji. 
3. Select **Save**.

Once saved, your emoji is added to the list of Custom Emoji.

.. note::

  If you can't see the **Custom Emoji** option, then your Mattermost System Admin may have restricted access to certain users. Contact your Mattermost System Admin for help.

Using Custom Emojis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use your Custom Emoji in a message, simply type ``:`` followed by your emoji name to bring it up in the emoji autocomplete. Other users on the site will also be able to see your emoji in the autocomplete, and will be able to use it in their own messages.

1. Open the Emoji Picker.
2. Select **Custom Emoji**.
3. If required, use the Search Bar to find your Custom Emoji in the list.
4. Under **Actions** select **Delete**.
5. Choose **Delete** to confirm.
