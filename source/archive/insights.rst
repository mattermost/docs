  From Mattermost v8.0, Insights has been disabled for all new instances and for existing servers that upgrade to Mattermost v8.0.

Insights offer you visibility into top activities by surfacing the most important events happening within each team within your Mattermost workspace. 

From Mattermost v7.1, insights are available for all users using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, except guests. Mobile support for insights is coming in a future release.

Access insights
---------------

To access insights, go to Channels, then select **Insights** at the top of the channel sidebar. On the Insights page, you'll see your own insights over the last seven days by default. You can also:

- Switch between your insights and insights for the team.
- Show insights for the current day or the last 28 days.
- Select insights to go directly to that channel, thread, or board.

.. note::
  From Mattermost v7.5, Insights for top channels and thread counts don't include messages posted by plugins and OAuth apps.

.. note:: 

  - Team insights are based on all public channels available as well as private channel membership. System Admins must be a member of private channels to see threads from those channels.
  - System Admins who can't see public threads without joining them first indicates that compliance export is enabled for the Mattermost deployment. When enabled, compliance export requires a record of every user having joined a channel so that a compliance system knows who has access to messages.
