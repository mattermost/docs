User Experience Guidelines
==========================

The purpose of the Mattermost User Experience Guidelines ("UX Guidelines") is to deliver a level of usability and consistency that turns users of Mattermost software into fans of the Mattermost experience.

If you're interested in contributing to design discussions, please join the `Mattermost UX Design channel to discuss <https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design>`__.

Design Principles
*****************

These principles define the standard we’re setting for the Mattermost experience.

1) Fast, Obvious, Forgiving
--------------------------------

**Fast**

Fast has two parts: being "responsive" and being "quick".

*Responsive* means when a user clicks, taps, types or otherwise enters input we give immediate feedback that the input is received and something is happening. It could be a spinner animation, or just some text saying “Loading”, but something always responds to the user.

*Quick* means things happen as soon as they can. Loading pages, sending messages, receiving notifications and other vital actions should be automatically benchmarked for performance. Bugs should be opened on performance regressions.

**Obvious**

There is no such thing as "user error"--it’s always our fault as product designers. We prevent problems of incorrect usage by making users aware of correct usage. Fixes could be through user interface improvements, adjustments to help text or helping users recover when things go wrong–for example, adding undelete, undo and rolling back.

When our product is correct, users are never confused. Everything we do--features, interface layout, labeling, help text and documentation--needs to make sense in the mind of the user, even if it means occasionally oversimplifying how things technically work.

If a user doesn’t understand how to use a feature, all the underlying effort and code is wasted. The “Obvious” design principle also flows through to our `Documentation Guidelines <https://mattermost.org/documentation-guidelines/>`__.

Given `Hick’s Law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law>`__, core functionality should be apparent, and advanced functionality should be possible via sub-menus and be well documented and tested. Functionality that is not fundamental to the product purpose should be ruthlessly omitted.

Use design patterns familiar to our audience--general non-technical users for the core messaging experience, IT administrators for configuration experience, developers for the developer experience. Mattermost UX should be drawn from patterns and derivations of other experiences in a mix of familiar approaches. Remember: Software is an invention--there's nothing "intuitive" about it, there is only what is familiar.

**Forgiving**

There will be unavoidable product failures, whether through technical issues like loss of connectivity or through our inability to make the user aware of correct usage. Being forgiving means reducing the negative impact users encounter during failures--not losing their data, not deleting, updating or sending something they didn't intend to send, and so forth.

Features like confirmation dialogs on critical actions or temporarily saving user input in case of disconnect are examples of forgiveness.

That said, forgiving does not mean allowing the product to be used incorrectly by breaking the "Obvious" principle. As an analogy, if someone kicks a football and misses the goal, being forgiving means giving them a chance to kick again, it does not mean counting the miss as a goal.

2) International, Compatible, Priority-focused
-------------------------------------------------

**International** - Design with an international, multi-lingual audience in mind. Use patterns and language without US, Western or culture-specific references when possible.

**Compatible** - When aligned with our other design principles, we should deploy UX and integration patterns from the other products for which we support the import of teams and users.

**Priority-focused** - Communication is a starting point towards the end goal of helping users within an enterprise achieve their highest priorities through modern communication. We prefer the term "messaging" to convey the sending of thoughtful communications that moves ideas forward, to the term "chat", which doesn't imply progress.

-----

Technical Guidelines
********************

Plugins
-----------------

By default, every new feature should be a plugin. Why?

 - Isolates complexity.
 - Disabled by default and must be turned on by a System Admin.
 - Grows the plugin ecosystem with better support for external plugins.

Reasons you might not want to write a plugin:

 - The feature requires high performance access.
 - The feature would be used or extended by a plugin (e.g. bot accounts or Account Settings modal).
 - The feature would be used by every Mattermost instance (e.g. flagged messages, replies).

Reasons to write a plugin:

 - To customize the Mattermost user interface.
 - To extend Mattermost functionality to meet a specific, complex requirement.
 - To build integrations that are managed by your Mattermost server.
 - To prototype a new feature with a plugin.

Bootstrap Classes
-----------------

Since we’re using `bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__, try to utilize `bootstrap classes <http://getbootstrap.com/css/>`__ as much as possible rather than creating new styles or using inline styles.

Custom Styles
-------------

We’re using `BEM methodology <https://en.bem.info/method/>`__  and would advise everyone to do so when creating new classes or ids. There are many places in our app that currently don’t follow BEM, but we’re trying to improve the codebase. `Here <http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/>`__ is a brief overview of the BEM syntax.

-----

Screen and Content Dimensions
*****************************

Web/Desktop App
-------------------

The webapp supports two main modes of displaying the app: desktop view and mobile/tablet view. The app is primarily used in desktop view, but when the screen is 768 pixels or less wide, it switches to mobile view. The mobile view is also used in mobile browsers and the Classic App.

For desktop view:

 - The target screen sizes are 1280 x 800 or 1920 x 1080. Note that the space available for content will be smaller than this due to the the frame of the window and system-specific components like the taskbar on Windows. For example, the desktop app on Windows 10 only has a usable height of 717 pixels when the tab bar is visible at 1280 x 800 resolution.
 - The minimum content size is 769 x 600. When the width is 768 or less, the app switches to mobile view. When the height is below 600, UI elements may become misplaced.

For mobile view:

 - The minimum and target content size is 320 x 460, matching the available space when the app is opened in Safari on an iPhone 5.

Mobile App
----------

At this time, the mobile app only supports an equivalent of mobile view. In that view:

 - The minimum and target content size is 320 x 568, matching the screen size of an iPhone 5. Note that you'll still need to leave space for system-specific components like the status bar or soft buttons on iOS, but much more of the screen is usable.

-----

UX Feedback Guidelines
****************************

User experience design is a discipline drawing from ergonomics, ethnography, human factors research and cognitive psychology. It's evaluated qualitatively with tools like heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs, and quantitatively through telemetry, anonymous usage data and other automated diagnostics.

As with any design process, iteration, prototyping, informed critique and evaluation is vital to doing our best work. Developing the skill of informed critique in our community increases the quality of our designs and of our product.

This guide outlines the levels of UX feedback in the order of positive impact in order to guide contributors towards the behaviors that best advance a fast-moving, asychronously-developed open source product.

**Entry-level UX feedback:** Authentic questions or suggestions for design changes, presented with good intentions, coming from personal preferences with less than 2 minutes spent thinking about the pros and cons of the changes the feedback suggests.

Example 1: Well intentioned suggestion that does not consider pros and cons.

   Why not change channel length from 22 characters to 50 characters?



Example 2: Attempt to help provide "input" in a design discussion, but instead of using objective criteria such as audience, community, customers, examples, research or principles, expresses a political "vote" that may bias or confuse a design discussion.

   +1, that is my personal preference!

While it's important to welcome people sharing entry-level feedback, and to extract from it useful ideas where possible, if entry-level feedback begins to unintentionally shut out more constructive feedback, a private note might be sent to the contributor with something like: "Highly appreciate your good intentions to share UX feedback. May I ask your help to review Mattermost's UX Feedback Guidelines (link)?"

**Intermediate UX feedback:** - Comments, critique or questions about design with thoughtful consideration--including trade-offs--of the goal and principles of a design, along with UX principles of the project, and patterns from other products.

Feedback speaks for itself, with relevant references to principles, audience, research and other objective criteria. May include descriptions of experience using the feature or similar features that can be generalized to the intended audience:

Example: Thoughtful suggestion listing trade-offs that reference principles.

   What if we used a reply icon, similar to replies in email, for the comment function? Screenshots below. Pros: a) More familiar to email users. b) More distinct than the word balloon icon typically used for "Comment", which is too easily confused for "Message".  Cons: i) We use the symbol of "Reply" for "Comment" (the UI has an "Add Comment" button in the UI), which could be confusing. ii) When we add a "Forward" icon later to move a message to a different channel, the "Reply" and "Forward" metaphors may get muddled".

UX feedback at intermediate level or higher is highly appreciated. It should be encouraged and recognized as a substantial contribution to the design process.

**Advanced UX feedback:** - Constructive feedback that enlightens a design discussion, shares fact-based heuristics, helps clear blindspots and inconsistencies, and significantly improves a design, and potentially design guidelines. Analysis naturally considers variations needed across web, PC and mobile experiences.

Example: Noticing a design issue and influencing a change in UX guidelines to correct things system-wide.

   A menu with 10 items without groupings seems too long. Both Apple (link) and Windows (link) user interface guidelines suggest fewer than 7 options before grouping. I'd propose we use fewer than 5. There's research showing 5 items as a number most people can comfortably store mentally (link), and looking through other products I don't see situations where we wouldn't be able to group by 5. Also, fewer menu items, perhaps through sub-menus, should also help mobile experience, where ungrouped 10-item menus just look messy. I've added a PR on UX guidelines where we can discuss this as well.

Design Guidelines
*****************

Display: Alignment
------------------

**Elements should feature margins horizontally and vertically, evenly spaced.**

Create space between elements, such as buttons, text, line separators, headers and backgrounds, by leaving even space around them (either equal space or at most 1 pixel difference).

    **Examples:**

        Button positioned in the middle of the header.
            ..  image:: ../images/align1.jpg
                :alt: Button positioning
                :width: 500 px

        Error message does not extend beyond the horizontal line separator.
            ..  image:: ../images/align2.png
                :alt: Confined messages with respect to width
                :width: 500 px

**Horizontally align multi-line elements along a vertical line.**

    **Example:**

        Roles right-justified with respect to the text and irrespective of the icon.
            ..  image:: ../images/align3.jpg
                :alt: Vertically justified
                :width: 500 px

---------------------------

Display: Button Placement
-------------------------

**Button in the footer of the dialog should either be “Close”, or “Cancel” and [ACTION_BUTTON].**

If there’s one button on the bottom right, it should be “Close”. If there are two, the one on the left should be “Cancel” and the one on the right should be an [ACTION_BUTTON], like “Save” or “Send Invitations”.

**Example:**

    Correct:
        Single button at the bottom right should be “Close”.

        ..  image:: ../images/buttonPlacement1.png
            :alt: Button Placement 1
            :width: 500 px

    Correct:
        When there are two buttons on bottom right, left button should be “Cancel” and the button on the right should be the [ACTION_BUTTON], in this case “Send Invitations”.

        ..  image:: ../images/buttonPlacement2.png
            :alt: Button Placement 2
            :width: 500 px

    Incorrect:
        When there are two buttons at the bottom right, left button should not be “Close”, as it’s not clear if closing will or won’t execute the [ACTION_BUTTON].

        ..  image:: ../images/buttonPlacement3.png
            :alt: Button Placement 3
            :width: 500 px

-----

Display: Button States
---------------------------

All buttons should have a visually distinct appearance for the following states (if applicable):

- default
- on_hover / on_hover (w tooltip)
- active
- disabled (greyed out or hidden)

The color of the on_hover state should be the same as in active state, with opacity = 0.7.

**Example:**

    ..  image:: ../images/buttonDesign.png
        :alt: Button design

---------------------------

Display: Icons
--------------

1. When to use icons
    a. When there’s not enough space for the label and an icon can easily represent the label.
    b. When an icon can help the user more quickly understand a feature.

2. When not to use icons
    a. When the term/phrase is too specific or complicated.

3. Icons should vary across different options
    a. When using icons, different options in the same section should have different icons.

4. Testing
    a. File a bug if the icon is difficult to understand or has cosmetic defects (size, blur, etc.).
    b. File a bug when an icon doesn’t obviously indicate the underlying feature.

---------------------------


Display: Instructions
---------------------

**Instructions should be sentences, one-line links should be fragments.**

Instructions, such as “A password reset link has been sent to ``you@email.com`` for your account. Please check your inbox.”, should be displayed as sentences ending in periods. One-line links, such as “Find it here”, should not end in periods or commas, but question marks are okay.

Instructions that contain a link to an external resource (e.g.: a blog article or docs.mattermost.com), should link to a redirect page and not be hard-coded. Redirect pages should be formatted as ``https://mattermost.com/default-[SUBJECT]``. If the page you're linking to doesn't exist, a new mattermost.com page can be requested from the Product team at Mattermost.

    **Example:**

        Correct:
            Instruction “Please check your inbox”, ending with a period.

            ..  image:: ../images/align5.jpg
                :alt: Period added
                :width: 300 px

        Incorrect:
            Instruction “Please check your inbox”, ending without a period.

            ..  image:: ../images/align4.png
                :alt: Period Missing
                :width: 300 px


---------------------------

Display: Tooltips
---------------------------

Tooltip text may be title case or sentence case depending on its context.

- Tooltips should be title case if the tooltip is a noun, e.g. "Pinned Posts", or "Flagged Posts".
- Tooltips should be sentence case if they are declaring an action, e.g. "Flag for follow up", or "Create new private channel".

---------------------------

Display: Username display
---------------------------

Usernames should be preceded by the @ icon in all places except for the Direct Messages list in the left-hand sidebar, and for any post or comment made by the user.

Examples of where an @ icon should precede the username are as follows:

- User list in the system console.
- Autocomplete.
- Members list for the current channel.

---------------------------

Display: Number of Choices
--------------------------

To simplify decisions, when practical, limit the number of choices to 3 or 4, and add separators or headings between logical groups. See `Hick’s Law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law>`__ for background on why this helps.

Example:

    Incorrect:
        No clear separation between distinct options.

        ..  image:: ../images/choices1.png
            :alt: No separation
            :width: 500 px

    Correct:
        A clear separation between distinct options.

        ..  image:: ../images/choices2.png
            :alt: Clear separation
            :width: 500 px

-----

Feedback: Error Messages
------------------------

On occasion, Mattermost users may encounter a problem that prevents them or the Mattermost system from successfully completing a task. The unexpected user behavior or system response should be communicated to the user through an error message, and should follow the design principles of forgiving and obvious.

Error messages should:

- State the encountered problem with the component in the title (e.g. "Team URL Not Found").
- Describe very briefly why the error happened under the title.
- When possible, have a link to direct users to help complete their original task or return to the previous state.
- Give recommendations/solution(s) for the next course of action.
- Be consistent with the Mattermost voice and professional look.
- Be avoided when possible (by avoiding the error condition).

Error messages should not:

- Be in red or in capital letters.
- Say or have the term “Error”.
- Be lengthy.
- Be generic.
- End in an exclamation point.

**Examples:**

    Incorrect:
        This is an example of a bad error message:

    ..  image:: ../images/error2.png
        :alt: Bad Error Message

    Correct:
        This is an example of a good error message:

    ..  image:: ../images/error1.png
        :alt: Good Error Message

-----

Feedback: System Notice
------------------------

On occasion, Mattermost users may encounter a system notice generated by Mattermost as part of a recent release. The system notice should be communicated to the user via a pop-over message in the bottom right of the screen, and should follow the design principles of `Fast, Obvious, Forgiving </developer/fx-guidelines.html#fast-obvious-forgiving>`__.

Notice messages should:

- State that the notice is from Mattermost.
- Describe very briefly and in an unintimidating tone the reason of the notice.
- When possible, include a link that directs users to help documentation related to the notice description.
- Be clear who can see the message.
- Give three action options: a link that can be clicked, "remind me later" button or "don't show again" button.
- Be consistent with the Mattermost voice and professional look.
- Be used very selectively to highlight significant change(s) within the current release.

Notice messages should not:

- Be in colored text or in capital letters.
- Exclude who can see the message.
- Be lengthy.
- Be generic.
- End in an exclamation point.

**Examples:**

    Incorrect:
        This is an example of a bad system notice:

    ..  image:: ../images/systemnotice2.png
        :alt: Bad System Notice


    Correct:
        This is an example of a good system notice:

    ..  image:: ../images/systemnotice1.png
        :alt: Good System Notice

-----

Input: Fields
-------------

Users should enter information into fields without much thinking. Enter button on last input field should trigger default dialog button.

**Example 1:**

    If focus is on the last input field in dialog (“Miller”), hitting Enter triggers the default dialog button (“Send Invitations”)

    ..  image:: ../images/inputField1.png
        :alt: Input Field Enter
        :width: 500 px

**Example 2:**

    Having radio buttons for input options.
    **NOTE**: We should use radio buttons/checkboxes for input options rather than custom bootstrap on/off switches.

    ..  image:: ../images/inputField2.png
        :alt: Radio Buttons
        :width: 500 px

---------------------------

Input: Hints
------------

Mattermost voice for documentation and help text follows this simple guideline: explain something to a user with basic computer skills in simple terms without jargon or complexity.

**Fieldname:**

    The labels on input fields should be clear and concise for the intended user. Consider the surrounding UI for consistent naming of input fields with similar actions.

    Correct:
        Channel URL: The web address used to reach your channel.

    Incorrect:
        Handle: The name of the subdirectory used to navigate to a channel using the site URL appended with the handle name. Must use only valid URL inputs.

    The fieldname of a setting should explicitly describe what a setting affects.

    Correct:
        Automatically expand link previews.

    Incorrect:
        Link previews

**Help text:**

    Text below an input field should clearly and concisely describe the purpose of the input in an active voice.

    In general, avoid describing the technical requirements of the field in Help Text, and use Placeholder input text, field validation and error messages to convey requirements. The exception to this guideline is if requirements are non-obvious, such as passwords needing different numbers of characters, symbols, etc.

    For a setting involving a CONDITION and an ACTION, the help text should be written as "ACTION when/for CONDITION".

    Correct:
        Flash the taskbar icon when a new message is received.

    Incorrect:
        When a new message is received, flash the taskbar icon.

    Ensure plural interpretations work when applicable and test help text with machine translation to reduce non-obvious, English-specific jargon:

    Correct:
        You can adjust a few configuration settings when setting up your instance of Mattermost.

    Incorrect:
        There are a few configuration settings you might want to fiddle with when setting up your instance of Mattermost.

    Note: The incorrect string above machine-translated into German and then back into English becomes: "There are some configuration settings you could know if your instance Matter Most violin".

**Placeholder input text:**

    Show examples of valid input, such as ``name@example.com`` for email addresses, as well as examples of functionality that is not obviously supported. For example, for a channel name field the placeholder input text could be ``Example: Marketing, John’s Room, 中国业务``.

**Field validation:**

    Use field validation to help prevent or correct any mistakes a user might make.

        For **textfields**, restrict users from making entries that are too long by limiting characters via the ``maxlength`` attribute.

        For **textareas**, show a character counter and then a helpful message if the user exceeds the maximum number of characters.

        **Example 1:**

            ..  image:: ../images/valid1.png
                :alt: Character count
                :width: 500 px

            ..  image:: ../images/valid2.png
                :alt: Character count
                :width: 500 px

        **Example 2:**

            If a user enters invalid uppercase letters and spaces for a URL, show an error message and also offer a correction, substituting dashes for spaces and lower case letters for uppercase letters, so that the user can resubmit immediately with valid input.

-----

Input: Input Patterns
---------------------

All inputs such as textareas should behave consistently. If the default behavior is to perform an action on "Enter", then all inputs of that type should be consistent and perform an action on "Enter".

**Example 1:**
    If pressing "Enter" posts a message in the center channel post input...

    ..  image:: ../images/inputBehaviour1.png
        :alt: Center channel post area

**Example 2:**
    ...then pressing "Enter" in the comment thread textarea should also post a comment...

    ..  image:: ../images/inputBehaviour2.png
        :alt: Comment thread textarea

**Example 3:**
    ...and other textareas or inputs should also perform their primary action when "Enter" is pressed. Here's an example of the "Edit Header" modal:

    ..  image:: ../images/inputBehaviour3.png
        :alt: Edit header modal
        :width: 500 px

-----

Input: Validation
-----------------

**Feedback on action:**

User should be notified about the action they perform along with any implications associated with them.

  Example 1:
    "Settings are saved but will be applied after a server restart."

      ..  image:: ../images/confirm2.jpg
          :alt: Settings saved

  Example 2:
    "Link copied to clipboard."

      ..  image:: ../images/confirm1.jpg
          :alt: Confirmation message

**Save prompt:**

A prompt should appear if a user makes changes to a setting and attempts to navigate away without saving them.

  Example:
    "You have unsaved changes, are you sure you want to discard them?"

      ..  image:: ../images/save1.png
          :alt: Save prompt

---------------------------

Menu items
----------

Items in a menu should be grouped together based on the category they belong to. Items per category however should not exceed five, with the exception of seven for the System Console.

**Example:**

    ..  image:: ../images/group.png
        :alt: Center channel post area

-----

Notifications: Header Bar
-------------------------

The header bar appears as a dropdown bar from the top of the screen. The header bar:

1. May include an "x" button to dismiss.
2. Is limited to 60 characters.
3. May include a time-out.
4. Appears over the rest of the UI instead of pushing the UI down.

Multiple headers can appear, with the earliest notification at the top and more recent notifications appearing underneath.

**Desktop**

    ..  figure:: ../images/header1.png
        :alt: Header Notification Desktop

**Mobile**

    ..  image:: ../images/header2.png
        :alt: Header Notification Mobile

There are several modes for this element:

    **System-wide header notification:**

        - Triggered on login.
        - Includes “x” button to dismiss.
        - No timeout.
        - Removed when system admin cancels.

        | Examples:
        | “Try our new Windows App. Click here to download.”,
        | “Scheduled maintenance 2:00am to 2:30am starts in 20 minutes, 3 seconds.”

    **Action required header notification:**

        - Triggered on login.
        - No “x” button to dismiss.
        - No timeout.
        - Dismissed when action completed.

        | Examples:
        | “We’re evolving. Please review and accept our new terms of service.”

    **Persistent issue header notification:**

        - Triggered on issue.
        - No “x” button to dismiss.
        - Dismissed when issue no longer persists.

        | Examples:
        | “You are not connected to the internet.”

-----

Markdown Rendering
---------------------

Markdown rendering in Mattermost is designed to be a fast, obvious and forgiving formatting standard for a messaging application. To achieve this goal, it has variations from markdown in GitHub (the most wildly used implementation), including:

- Bullets directly below a line of text render as a bullet, not as a continued line of text
- {Other variations to be concisely listed here, one line each}

While we intend to eventually document all the variations from GitHub markdown, until that is complete we consider any variation in rendering from the current release of Mattermost to be a regression that should either be fixed prior to the next release, or documented here.

Currently the `/test tool <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/tree/master/tests>`__ can be used for testing Mattermost markdown versus GitHub markdown.

-----

Organization: Reduce Obvious Steps
----------------------------------

If the action a user needs to perform is obvious, we should make conscious decisions to reduce some of the steps involved in that process.

    **Example 1:**
        Clicking on the search icon on mobile should focus the search bar when it slides in.

        ..  image:: ../images/reduce1.png
            :alt: Search mobile

    **Example 2:**
        Clicking on the reply icon should move the focus to the comment box in the right-hand sidebar.

        ..  image:: ../images/reduce2.png
            :alt: Reply icon

    **Example 3:**
        Switching channels should move the focus to the post box in the center channel.

        ..  image:: ../images/reduce3.png
            :alt: Switching channels

-----

Testing Checklist
-----------------

In addition to above guidelines, the below provides a concrete checklist of mistakes to watch for when reviewing proposed product changes.

User Experience Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1\) Is the WHITESPACE next to icons SUFFICIENTLY SPACED?**

    Example of not enough space next to FLAG icon on RIGHT:

    ..  image:: ../images/fx-guidelines-sufficient-whitespace.png
