Getting Started Checklist
-------------------------

Company Agreements
------------------

Hiring
-------

- (People Ops and New Hire) Offer letter accepted via click-sign.

T-minus 1-3 weeks
-----------------

- (People Ops and New Hire) People Ops should find out new hire's preference for laptop, either to be purchased or taken from stock and shipped by People Ops or purchased locally by new hire and expensed. Windows laptops generally cost less than Macs so budget is based on Macs. For non-developers, budget is cost of a MacBook in your local area, for developers budget is cost of a MacBook Pro. Since these items are company property, you do not need to buy insurance or extended warranties for them, but you do need to report any loss or damage to people@mattermost.com as soon as it occurs.
- (New Hire) Read the entirety of Onboarding page for info on meetings, mindsets, terminology, and training materials.
- (People Ops) Send email invite to New Hire to set up an @mattermost.com email address. New Hire should use this email address on community.mattermost.com (replace personal email with company email if already registered there). `FIRST_NAME.LAST_NAME@mattermost.com` is the standard naming convention.
 
T-minus 1 week
---------------

- (People Ops and New Hire) Set up payroll.

Channels
---------

This section has been moved to the `Mattermost Handbook <https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding/frequently-asked-questions#what-channels-should-i-join-to-get-a-feel-for-the-company/>`_.

Meetings
--------

This section summarizes norms for public and private meetings for the Mattermost community and for Mattermost staff (people paid by Mattermost, Inc.).

Timezones 
---------

When proposing meetings use famous cities as references for time (e.g. 9am Toronto time), since it's clear and `easy to web search <https://www.google.com/search?ei=8w9nXdn0HMH4-wTH1JrgCA&q=time+in+toronto&oq=time+in+toronto>`__. Avoid using "UTC", as it has been shown to cause confusion.

When selecting a timezone city, use the most well-known city in a country where at least one team member is located. Exception: When possible, use a city where we have an official mailing address, e.g. In Western Americas use Palo Alto, instead of San Francisco. In Eastern Americas use Toronto, instead of New York.

Scheduling Recurring Group Meetings
-----------------------------------

Recurring meetings with more than two people should have one or more regular slots on the calendar reserved so that meetings can be coordinated in a straight-forward way.

1. Meetings with internal colleagues should be coordinated by checking everyone's availability in G Suite Calendar.
2. Meetings with external colleagues should be coordinated manually with one internal person coordinating everyone's G Suite Calendars.

For efficiency, when Mattermost works with advisors and consultants who engage with two or more internal team members, we aim to schedule meetings in regular slots (or a collection of regular slots) 2-4 weeks apart.

Meeting Etiquette
-----------------

Inspired by Corey Hulen's blog article of `6 Annoying Things People Do During Video Conferencing <http://hulen.com/video-conf-peevs/>`__.

1. Avoid responding to messages in chat while on a meeting:

  - It can be distracting when someone tries to covertly respond to a message. First, other people on call may hear your keyboard and notice you’re looking somewhere else. Second, if they are in the same channel as you, they can see the message ``[User] is typing...`` in Mattermost.
  - **Tip:** If you feel the need to respond immediately and are easily distracted, set yourself to "Do Not Disturb" mode while in meetings.

2. Avoid answering calls or checking text messages on your cell phone:

  - **Tip:** Put your phone on silent and place it out of arm’s reach, face down, so you don’t feel compelled to act.

3. Display your video on a monitor with your camera:

  - If you have your video display on a second monitor, it may cause you to look away from the camera, not looking at the camera when talking. It almost feels like you’re talking to someone else in the room behind your computer monitor.
  
  - **Tip:** Either move your camera, or move your video window so they are somewhat inline. Also remember to look towards the camera.

4. Mute audio in large video conferences when not speaking:
 
  - When not muted, others can hear random noises, like a fan running or a loud click-clack keyboard, which can be distracting.
  
  - **Tip:** Set your Zoom meetings to be on mute by default via Zoom settings.

5. Avoid fidgeting uncontrollably or spinning in your office chair:

  - **Tip:** If you’re in a group meeting and not doing much talking, feel free to stop your video.

6. Avoid connecting with your computer but also dialing in via cell phone:
 
  - If you connect with your computer and dial in, there are two of you in the meeting and the voice/video are not synced when you talk. In large groups, there will be a random cell phone number that no one will know who they are.
  
  - **Tip:** If you have a bad internet connection and have to dial in, exit the Zoom meeting on your computer.
  
7. When presenting, increase window zoom size or set Powerpoint slides to presenter mode:

  - Otherwise, the text on screen may be too hard for others to see.

Frequently Asked Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Why don't new people introduce themselves?**

Not everyone is comfortable with speaking in front of 60+ people. Not everyone speaks clear English. We don’t want the first company-wide meeting to be anxious for new team members, hence by default managers intro them. New hires can opt-in to introducing themselves.

Sprint Planning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost staff only** - Each team is responsible for its own sprint planning process. Sprints are currently one week long, and start on Tuesdays. Note that teams also share demos and short updates with the whole product team in the "R&D Meeting" (see below).

- Goal: Share demos, reflect on previous sprint, and lock on tickets for next sprint.
- Attendees: Development team members (typically developers and product manager).

Triage Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost staff-only** - (Triage team - 2-2.5 hours/week) daily at 09:30 or 10:00 (`San Francisco Time <https://everytimezone.com/>`__).

- Goal: To provide consistent review, prioritization and ownership assignment of all tickets.
- Attendees: One dev representative from each development team, at least one PM, QA team, Release Manager, and optionally leads, customer support and other Mattermost staff.

**Note:**

- When tickets are first created, they go to triage to be reviewed for clarity and priority and assigned a Fix Version, Mattermost Team and Sprint. Unclear tickets may be assigned to their creator for more information.
     - The **Fix Version** determines the sequence in which tickets are addressed and triage team is accountable for that sequence. It is the responsibility of the triage team to make sure tickets are clear before they're assigned a Fix Version.
     - When assigning a ticket to a **Mattermost Team**, it gets assigned to a dev and put into the current release's Fix Version and the current sprint if the ticket is time-sensitive for release. Otherwise the ticket is assigned to a team with a "Triage" Fix Version and is later prioritized and assigned to the appropriate people within that team.
     - The **Sprint** determines the time frame within which a dev is responsible for fixing the ticket.

- If you're ever unsure about a ticket (if it's not clear, or doesn't seem appropriate) add a comment and add triage to the Fix Version field, which will trigger a review by the triage team in 1-6 working days.
     - **Note:** If the ticket is already assigned to a team, it will not appear in the triage query - easiest is to let the triage team know about the ticket so that it won't be missed.

Procedure:

1. (Attendees): Join Zoom meeting link in calendar invitation at scheduled time.
2. (Attendees): Review `query for tickets needing triage <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-8015?filter=15011>`__ and assign a development team, sprint, and fix version.

Leads Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost staff only** - (Leads - 1 hour/week) Wednesday (13:00 `San Francisco Time <https://everytimezone.com/>`__)

- Goal: Address leadership and process topics.
- Attendees: (Required) Leads from R&D, Marketing, Sales, and Operations.

Note:

- Decisions should go to Leads meetings when there is lack of clarity or ownership, or to discuss special case topics where process is not well defined.
    - When possible, decision-making should belong to the people closes to details.
    - Individual developers or PMs should make most decisions, and raise to developer or PM team if things are unclear, and go to Leads if lack of clarify persists.
- To queue an item for Leads ask the dev or PM lead.
- Leads is also used for cross-discipline Q&A.

    - Rather than randomize individual contributors, cross-discipline discussion (e.g. marketing to PM, community to dev, etc.) can happen in leads.

Procedure:

1. (Leads): Queue items in Leads channel for discussion.

2. (Leads): During meeting discuss agenda items in sequence.

R&D Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost Inc-only** - (Product Staff - 45 min/week) Thursdays at 09:00 (`San Francisco Time <https://everytimezone.com/>`__).

Meeting Elements
----------------

Here we summarize meeting elements that can be re-used for meetings across teams.

Ice-breaker
^^^^^^^^^^^

- 2-3 minute exercises designed to learn more about colleagues at the start of a recurring meeting.
- Typically rotates in random order with names pulled from the `R&D Meeting Ice-breaker List <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCgKFdYkaDYd7yzgbK2VcqscZ1Ni5uNnnkZZv63XtOg/edit#gid=0>`__, three colleagues per meeting (2 R&D staff, 1 'other' (e.g. Sales, Ops, etc).

- Examples:
   - "Hobby talk" - Sharing about an interesting hobby, past or present.
   - "My home town" - Sharing something interesting about where you grew up.
   - "Two truths and a lie" - Share two true facts about yourself and one lie, team guesses which is the lie.
   - "Questions" - e.g. "What would constitute a “perfect” day for you?"
   - Need further inspiration? Take a look `here <https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/the-25-most-popular-icebreaker-questions-based-on-four-years-of-data-893df9b27531>`__.

Blind spots, Inspiration, Knowledge Share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Exercise to find blindspots in team thinking at the end of a meeting.
- Items for team discussion can also be queued in this section.
- Colleagues share areas of concern and ask questions which invariably disclose blind-spots or are an opportunity to improve communication.
- Examples of questions:
    - "What's the status on X?" // often an important item that got forgotten.
    - "Who owns X?" // reveals need for more clarity or communication.
    - "Why do we do X?" // let's us verify if a process is needed, and if we're handling it the right way.

Mindsets
--------

This section has been moved to the `Mattermost Handbook <https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets/>`_.

Terminology
-----------

Designing world-class software means bringing people together across disciplines and cultures. We want to create a limited amount of shared terminology to help us work better together, while being careful not to make it difficult for newcomers to follow our conversation.

Perhaps in future we'll have a bot that helps teach newcomers about the terminology in-context. Until then we have this guide.

Purpose
-------

We use Mattermost terminology to achieve specific benefits:

1) Increase precision through unambiguous definitions of useful terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, "0/5" and "5/5" help convey the level of conviction behind an opinion. Also, a precise classification of tickets as "Bug" or "Improvement" is critical since it affects scheduling and decision making, and so forth.

2) Increase the speed of communication via a small number of frequently used acronyms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`LHS`_ and `RHS`_ are examples of a very limited number of acronyms to use to speed discussions, specifications, and ticket writing.

3) Reduce repeated mistakes by naming very specific undesirable behaviors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Naming specific repeated mistake helps us find patterns, avoid repeated mistakes in future, and helps newcomers avoid making similar mistakes as they learn our organization's terminology.

List of Terms
-------------

This section has been moved to the `Mattermost Handbook <https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms>`_.

Training
--------

At Mattermost, "Learn, Master, Teach" cycles are core to our culture. You should be constantly growing and cross-training into new skills and responsibilities, developing expertise, and then training your replacement as you prepare to take on new challenges.

Cross-training creates a culture of constant growth, protects against single-points of failure, and challenges each of us to rise to our fullest potential.

Roles
------

The "Learn, Master, Teach" cycle happens in the context of roles. Roles are sets of responsibility needed to achieve objectives. Roles aren't necessarily job titles, for small projects, a developer might take on a product manager role, or vice versa. Each team member has a "primary role" and training should move people to mastery and teaching in that role, before moving to the next role.

Developer
^^^^^^^^^

Developers are responsible for architecting and delivering software improvements, and for technical leadership among the Mattermost community.

- Architecture
    - Developers are responsible for researching, analyzing, designing and reviewing technical solutions to achieve functional requirements. Solutions should thoroughly consider trade-offs and be evaluated based on the effectiveness of the end implementation.

- Delivery
   - Based on technical designs, developers estimate, implement, test, maintain, review, debug and release software improvements in collaboration with teammates. This includes working closely with product managers to validate requirements and the output of designs and making appropriate adjustments. The success of implementation is judged on the end results achieved by the changes.

- Technical Community Leadership
   - As leading experts on Mattermost technology, developers support and engage constantly with the broader Mattermost community to accelerate adoption and to discover new ways to improve Mattermost software and processes. This includes investigating and  supporting issues from users and customers, reviewing and providing feedback on projects from contributors, and understanding priorities, trends and patterns across the community.

Product Managers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Product Managers are responsible for aligning teams to strategic priorities, leading and managing the product development process, and working effectively with marketing to bring the full benefits of Mattermost solutions to users and customers.

- Strategy
   - Every project and every team needs to align to strategic priorities and focus on intended outcomes developed through a deep understanding of the market, user, customers and competing products and services. Amid a flood of compelling suggestions, opinions, and data, product managers must find what's vital, and rally teams around a shared vision.

- Product development
   - Product Managers lead both the functional design process (user, customer and competitor research, analysis, ideation, prioritization, functional and user experience design, functional specification, user and customer validation), and the software development process (ticketing, prioritization, roadmap design, scheduling, sprint planning, triage, functional verification, implementation validation with users and customers, documentation, and release logistics).
   - It's the Product Manager's responsibility to see features shipped predictably and at high quality through planning, attention to detail and thoughtful persuasion.

- Marketing connection
   - Delivering benefits to users and customers based on product features is a core responsibility of product managers, working in conjunction with marketing to shape messaging and positioning and delivering collateral, events, and user and customer discussions to support sales.

Resources
---------

The following is a list of recommended resources for developing skills "the Mattermost way" in different areas. For the ones that require purchase, message your manager to request an order, whether as physical books, digital books, audiobooks, or other formats.

Consulting Advisers
-------------------

To provide guidance, coaching and development for senior and functional leaders, we bring in experts to advise in key areas.

- As an example, `Jono Bacon <http://www.jonobacon.org/about/>`__--a leading author, speaker and consultant on open source community advocacy--meets with our CEO and community team regularly to refine our processes and understanding. There's a range of similarly adept company advisers that help advance our thinking and capabilities in critical ways.

Meetings typically take place over phone or video calls. We bring on advisers with `standard consulting agreements <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.pwxwwq4ezzfx>`_ on either a time and materials basis or a recurring fee.

We use a range of advisers from senior board-level contributors to operational and subject-matter experts.

Mattermost Avatar
-----------------

When becoming a core committer to the Mattermost project we create a "Mattermost Avatar" for you as a fun way to recognize your new level of contribution.

Mattermost avatars are caricatures of core committers in the costume of a popular culture character (e.g. Spiderman, Wonder Woman, Luke Skywalker, etc.) created for personal use, and which may be potentially used in team rosters, demonstration sites, "group photos" where avatar images from the team are collected in one image of all the characters together, and other public uses.

To have a Mattermost avatar created, you'll be invited to create a Mattermost avatar via email:

1. Please use the email subject "[YOUR_FULL_NAME] as [CHARACTER_NAME]", for example "Corey Hulen as Han Solo".
2. Attach a clear image at least 600 pixels high and 600 pixels wide showing your character's full body in a standing pose.
3. Send a clear photo of your face at least 600 pixels high and 600 pixels wide facing the same direction as your character image.

Notes: 

1. Character should be human-sized (no giant characters).
2. Character's appearance should be family-friendly. For example, no gory or provocative costumes.
 
You should receive your digital Mattermost avatars by email in 6-8 weeks.

In special cases, a Mattermost avatar may be created for someone from the Mattermost community who has made an extraordinary contribution to the open source project.

Mattermost Teams and Naming Conventions
---------------------------------------

Staff must use their full name for their username, as in ``first.last``, on the community server. Staff are also encouraged to link to their GitHub account using the command `/github connect` so that your GitHub handle will appear on your profile pop-over card.  All Mattermost  staff should be issued a OneLogin account with a username of ``first.last``.  If issued a OneLogin account, you should switch your sign-in method from email/password to OneLogin via **Account Settings > Security > Sign-in Method** page.  Once this is done, your username will be set from SAML.

Contributors Team
-----------------

This is a team open for any and all to join.  It is the main place where staff, contributors, users, customers and partners interact.  Our goal is to do as much work as possible in the open.  If you find yourself creating a private channel on this team you should pause and ask yourself if it really needs to be private.  Mattermost staff will be synced to the appropriate channels based on their LDAP group sync settings.

Staff Team
----------

This is restricted to people with an `@mattermost.com` email address.  It is meant for Mattermost employees and staff and is where we discuss internal company matters.  Since this team only includes people with mattermost.com email address, you should prefer creating public channels.  Also, if you find yourself creating a channel here, you should ask yourself if it would be better served to have it in the Contributors team.  Mattermost staff will be synced to the appropriate channels based on their LDAP group sync settings.

Partners Team
-------------

This is an invite-only team meant for Mattermost staff and partners.  This is a team for staff to interact with partners and for partners to interact with other partners. You should prefer public channels when you want partner-to-partner interactions and private channels when you want staff-to-partner interactions.  Remember that any partner added to the team will be able to join any public channel.
