Documentation Guidelines
========================

The Mattermost Style Guide is in the process of being migrated to the `Mattermost Handbook <https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines/documentation-style-guide>`_. It acts as a reference for writers and editors to ensure that the Mattermost documentation is consistent and clear.

.. Note::
  This guide is not intended to slow down or otherwise impede contributions, which are always welcome. No contribution will be rejected due to non-conforming style, although it might be edited.
