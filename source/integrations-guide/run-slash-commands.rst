Run Slash Commands
==================

Using a slash command is as easy as composing a message. Instead of message text, you start slash commands with a slash character: ``/``. 

For example, if you want to log out of Mattermost using only your keyboard, you can enter ``/logout`` in the message text box and select **Send**. 

Because your message starts with a slash ``/``, Mattermost knows it's a slash command, and performs the action defined for that command.
