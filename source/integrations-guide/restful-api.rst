**Technical complexity:** :ref:`Pro-code <pro-code>`

Full developer control for automation, bots, and integrations.

The `Mattermost API <https://developers.mattermost.com/api-documentation/>`_ provides a comprehensive set of endpoints that let you programmatically interact with your Mattermost workspace. With the API, you can manage users, teams, channels, posts, and more, making it possible to automate administrative tasks, integrate external systems, and build custom applications that extend Mattermost functionality. Whether you’re writing lightweight scripts or developing full-scale integrations, the API offers flexible building blocks to tailor Mattermost to your workflows.

Using the API is a pro-code approach meant for developers who want to write scripts to automate specific workflows or build deeply customized integrations using the plugin framework to connect external systems. 

The API is often used in combination with `bot accounts <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/bot-accounts/>`_ to authenticate and interact with Mattermost.
