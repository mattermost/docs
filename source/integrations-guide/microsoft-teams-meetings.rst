Use
-----

Users who want to use MS Teams Meetings interconnectivity must connect a Microsoft Teams Meetings account to Mattermost. 

Once connected, you'll receive direct messages from the Microsoft Teams Meetings bot in Mattermost for Microsoft Teams Meetings activity.

Connect a Microsoft Teams account to Mattermost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the `/mstmeetings connect` slash command to connect an MS Teams account to Mattermost.

Start a call
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start a call either by selecting the video icon in a Mattermost channel or by running the `/mstmeetings start` slash command. Every meeting you start creates a new meeting room in Microsoft Teams. 

.. note::
    
    If you start two meetings less than 30 seconds apart you'll be prompted to confirm that you want to create the meeting.

Disconnect a Microsoft Teams account from Mattermost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the `/mstmeetings disconnect` slash command to disconnect a Microsoft Teams account from Mattermost.
