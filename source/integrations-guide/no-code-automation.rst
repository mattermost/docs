No-Code Automation
===================

**Technical complexity:** :ref:`No-code <no-code>`

Platforms like n8n, Zapier, or Make provide powerful visual editors that support thousands of connected tools, with triggers and actions that integrate Mattermost to external services, enabling teams to build complex workflows without writing code. Admins migrating from tools like Slack Workflow Builder can recreate familiar automations in Mattermost using these platforms.

When used in comination with outgoing webhooks or custom slash commands, users can trigger complex workflows and automations without leaving Mattermost. By pointing a webhook or slash command at the unique URL these automation tools provide, any message or keyword in Mattermost can initiate a workflow. This allows you to capture context from conversations and pass it into external systems — for example, creating tickets, updating records, or starting multi-step automations.

Choosing the best platform for your team depends on your specific integration requirements, hosting preferences, and technical capabilities. Learn more about the capabilities of each platform below:  

.. tab:: n8n
  :parse-titles:

  `n8n <https://n8n.io/>`_ is ideal for organizations prioritizing data residency and security, since it is self-hosted and can be supported in air-gapped environments where cloud solutions like Zapier and Make might not be feasible. 

  Additonally, n8n supports both :ref:`no-code <no-code>` and :ref:`low-code <low-code>` approaches, making it flexible for technical and semi-technical users. Being open source means there’s a large community of people sharing their custom workflows and automations that can either be used directly or iterated on to meet your specific requirements.

  n8n stands out for offering rich AI integration, enabling you to combine automation with AI-powered workflows. Its `native AI Agent node <https://n8n.io/ai/>`_ lets you integrate large language models, vector databases, and other AI services directly into your automations. This means you can build workflows in Mattermost that not only react to events but also analyze context, summarize discussions, or make decisions based on AI output.

  Supported Triggers
  -------------------

  - MattermostTrigger (community node): Listens for Mattermost events via WebSocket events, such as new post and users added.

  You can also use outgoing webhooks or slash commands in Mattermost as triggers using the `Webhook node <https://n8n.io/integrations/webhook/>`_.

.. tab:: Make
  :parse-titles:

  Make offers a more visual and flexible approach to automation, allowing you to build complex workflows with advanced logic and data manipulation. Make offers one of the most expansive sets of out-of-the-box triggers and actions for Mattermost. 

  Make is hosted in the cloud, and excels at more complex multi-step workflows while still keeping the configuration non-technical.

  - Deactivate a User Account: Archive or disable a user account.
  - Delete a Command: Remove a command by its ID.
  - Delete a Post: Remove a post.
  - Execute a Command: Run or trigger an existing command.

  You can also use outgoing webhooks or slash commands in Mattermost as triggers using the `Webhook app <https://www.make.com/en/integrations/gateway>`_.

.. tab:: Zapier
  :parse-titles:

  Zapier is ideal for non-technical users who want the fastest path to connect Mattermost with over 7000+ SaaS apps. It’s hosted in the cloud, easy to set up, and best for common business workflows.

  Zapier’s strength is the breadth of integrations. Without coding, you can integrate Mattermost with everything from CRMs to social media. This is perfect for non-technical users who want to automate notifications or routine tasks, such as posting daily reports or sending Mattermost channel messages when forms are submitted. Zapier provides a user-friendly wizard and template library to get started quickly.

  Explore building workflows with the `Mattermost Zapier integration <https://n8n.io/integrations/mattermost/>`_.

  Supported Triggers
  -------------------

  - Zapier does not natively support triggers in Mattermost. If you want Mattermost to trigger a Zapier workflow, you can use outgoing webhooks or slash commands in combination with `Zapier’s Webhooks trigger <https://zapier.com/apps/webhook/integrations>`_. For example, you could configure an outgoing webhook in Mattermost to hit Zapier when a certain keyword is posted, which Zapier treats as a trigger to then perform actions in other apps.

  Supported Actions
  ------------------

  - Compared with the wide range of triggers and actions supported by n8n or Make, Zapier supports only one action: posting a message.
