Custom-built plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Technical complexity:** :ref:`Pro-code <pro-code>`

Building a custom plugin for your self-hosted deployment is a **software development** task, using ``Go`` for the server-side functionality and optionally ``TypeScript/React`` for UI components. Developers should be comfortable with Git, modern build tooling, and the `Mattermost Plugin API <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/server/server-reference/>`_, including lifecycle hooks, KV storage, slash commands, and interactivity. Knowledge of testing, logging, and security best practices is essential for production-ready plugins, along with experience packaging and deploying plugins through the System Console or CLI. For teams without these skills, simpler options like webhooks, slash commands, or no-code workflow tools may be more practical.

Plugins can authenticate and interact with Mattermost through `bot accounts <https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/bot-accounts/>`_, utilizing the `RESTful API <https://developers.mattermost.com/api-documentation/>`_.
