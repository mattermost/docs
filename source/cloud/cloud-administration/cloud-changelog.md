# Mattermost Cloud Changelog

This changelog summarizes updates to [Mattermost Cloud](https://mattermost.com/get-started/), an enterprise-grade SaaS offering hosted by Mattermost.

## Release 2021-01-26

### Highlights

#### Channel Sidebar Improvements
 - New channel sidebar improvements include a configurable **Unreads** category as well as the ability to sort categories by recent activity or alphabetically in addition to manually.
 
### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added new languages, Bulgarian and Swedish.
 - Moved the header icons to the left of the header beside the channel description.

#### Plugins
 - Enabled experimental support for ARM64 plugins by allowing any matching ``GOOS-GOOARCH`` combination in the plugin manifest.

#### Administration
 - The ``UseExperimentalGossip`` field under ClusterSettings is now ``true`` by default. This means that new installations will use the Gossip protocol for cluster communication. There will be no changes to existing installations. The Gossip protocol is now considered to be in General Availability and is the recommended clustering mode.
 - ``AnalyticsPostCount`` now avoids unnecessary table scans during various background jobs.
 - Added a ``CollapsedThreads`` feature flag.
 - The Help text for the Rate Limiting setting was updated to explain the purpose of rate limiting.
 - Removed the word "experimental" from the Gossip setting in the System Console.
 - The Database search using PostgreSQL now supports searching for terms that contain underscores.
 - Deprecated the ``ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization`` setting and added a new ``EnableLegacySidebar`` setting. The new channel sidebar will be enabled system-wide by default.

#### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the Admin Filter option was not disabled in the AD/LDAP page for Admin roles with a ``sysconsole_write_authentication`` permission.
 - Fixed an issue where channels would sometimes be removed from custom categories when a user left a team.
 - Fixed an issue where the error text was missing when the team name was left blank on the Team Create page.
 - Fixed an issue where the System Manager was able to download the Compliance Export files.
 - Fixed an issue where themed button colours in interactive message attachments in Mattermost’s default dark theme were mismatched.
 - Fixed an issue where bold and italics shortcuts triggered with CTRL+B on Mac.
 - Fixed an issue where a "Your license does not support cloud requests” log error appeared on self-hosted servers.

#### Known Issues
 - Setting changes do not get saved on **System Console > Site Configuration > Public Links**.
 - Alignment of team icons are off on **System Console > User Management >Teams Page**.
 - Alignment of channel header text "This channel has guests" is off.
 - Sometimes an "Unable to get role" error appears when changing a channel member role on **User Management > Channel**.
 - **Cloud > "Tips & Next Steps"** should not show an "Explore channels" section for guest users.
 - System Roles shows **License** and **Environment** as possible permissions, but they are always hidden in Cloud.
