# Mattermost Cloud Changelog

This changelog summarizes updates to [Mattermost Cloud](https://mattermost.com/get-started/), an enterprise-grade SaaS offering hosted by Mattermost.

## Release 2021-02-24

### Highlights

#### Support Packet Generation
 - Allows a System Admin to download a support packet which provides helpful information to our internal support team.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Removed the 5-page limit on previewing PDFs.
 - Added "files" as a reserved team name.
 - Searching for a channel by URL now returns the channel.
 - Users are now provided with feedback when creating a custom category name that exceeds the character limit.

#### Administration
 - Added support for compressed export files with attachments.
 - Server crashes due to runtime panics are now captured as a log line.
 - Optimized Direct Message creation by fetching all users involved in a single database call.
 - During the user import process, a change in a user's ``NotifyProps`` will not send an email notification. This is done to make it consistent with other parts of the import process where a change in user's attributes would also not send any notifications.
 - Implemented a job to delete unused export files.
 - Improved the websocket implementation by using epoll to manually read from a websocket connection. As a result, the number of goroutines is expected to go down by half. This implementation is only available on Linux and FreeBSD-based distributions. If you are using NGINX as a proxy to Mattermost, please ensure to have ``proxy_http_version 1.1;`` in the block that handles the websocket path.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where demoting a user to a guest would not take effect in an environment with read replicas.

 - Fixed an issue where line breaks were ignored when used with inline images.
 - Fixed a panic when the OAuth discovery endpoint would not return a Cache-Control header.
 - Fixed an issue where the Cloud onboarding flow referenced OAuth, not OpenID Connect.

### Known Issues
 - PDF zoom fails to respond to zoom in/out/reset actions until the user scrolls.
 - In a reply thread with the right-hand side expanded, attachments in a post draft get hidden behind the center channel text box.
 - Sometimes an "Unable to get role" error appears when changing a channel member role in **System Console > User Management > Channels**.
 - **Cloud > "Tips & Next Steps"** should not show an "Explore channels" section for guest users.
 - System Roles shows **License** and **Environment** as possible permissions, but they are always hidden in Cloud.

## Release 2021-02-10

### Highlights

#### OpenID Connect (Cloud Professional & Enterprise)

 - Fixed an issue where the channel switcher did not focus on the first list result after a backspace.
 - Fixed an issue where the in-product instructions to search for users under **System Console > Reporting > Server Logs** were outdated.
