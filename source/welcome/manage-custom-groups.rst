You can configure custom groups of Mattermost users you want to notify together as a team using @mentions. For example, you may want to create a custom group that contains all managers within your organization with a group name of ``@managers``. You can mention a custom group the same way you use other @mentions, such as ``@username`` or ``@here``. See our Channels product documentation for details on `mentioning people in messages <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/mention-people>`__.
