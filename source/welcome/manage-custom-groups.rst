Custom groups (beta) reduce noise and improve focus by notifying the right people in a channel at the right time, while maintaining transparency for all members in that channel. Custom user groups let you notify up to 30 users at a time rather than notifying users individually. 

For example, perhaps you want to @mention a cross-functional team about a bug fixes needed for an upcoming feature release, without notifying everyone else in the channel. Using a custom group notifies the cross-functional team immediately, while keeping important stakeholders in the loop on the status of the feature release.

Once a custom user group has been created, you can mention that group the same way you @mention another Mattermost member. See the `mention people in messages <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/mention-people.html>`__ documentation for details.

.. note::
  
  - System Admins need to enable this feature. See our `Mattermost Configuration Settings <https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#custom-user-groups>`__ documentation for details. 
  - From Mattermost v7.2, System Admins can limit who can manage custom user groups through a system admin role, instead of all users being able to manage custom user groups. See the `system roles <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/system-admin-roles.html>`__ for details.
  - The ability to create custom user groups on mobile will be available in a future release. @mentions for custom user groups on mobile work the same as `LDAP-synced groups <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/mention-people.html#groupname>`__.

Create a custom group
---------------------

1. Select **+** from the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Create New User Group**.

2. Specify a name and mention. The mention is the handle you use to @mention a notification to the group. Group names must be unique across the Mattermost workspace. If a name is in use as a channel name, display name, or another custom group's name, it won't be available.

3. Search for and select members to add to the custom user group, then select **Create Group**.

Manage custom user groups
-------------------------

You can review and filter the list of custom groups, add people to an existing group, edit the group name or mention, leave the group, or archive the group. 

To manage a custom user group, select **User Groups** from the Products menu, then select the group you want to modify.
