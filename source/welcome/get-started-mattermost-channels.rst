Get started with Mattermost Channels
====================================

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

Using a web browser or the desktop app, you can access Mattermost Channels by selecting **Channels** from the **product menu** |product-list|. On mobile, you log in directly to Mattermost Channels.

Channels are where you can communicate with your team about various topics or projects. The channels you're a member of and useful channel management tools are available in the channel sidebar to the left. 

See our `Mattermost Channels </guides/channels.html>`__ documentation for details on the many ways you can use Channels to enable team collaboration.

Channels and direct messages
----------------------------

Everyone who joins a Mattermost workspace is automatically added to two default channels: **Town Square** and **Off-Topic**. See our `Channel Types </channels/channel-types.html>`__ documentation for details.

- **Town Square** is great for your team-wide communications, such as announcements.
- **Off-Topic** is great for fun, social, non-work-related conversations. 

Direct messages are private conversations between two people. 
Group messages are private conversations for small groups of up to seven people. 
Start a new direct or group message by selecting the **Plus** |plus| icon.

.. tip:: 
    Direct and group messages are also channels in Mattermost, so many of the `preferences available for channels </channels/set-channel-preferences.html>`__ are also available for direct messages. 

Create and join channels
------------------------

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a **Globe** |globe| icon. Anyone on the team can join a public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are identified with a **Lock** |lock| icon. You must be invited to private channels by another channel member.

- `Create channels </channels/create-channels.html>`__
- `Join and leave channels </channels/join-leave-channels.html>`__

As your channel sidebar fills up with channels you've joined, you can organize your channels into categories based on how you work. See the `customize your channel sidebar </channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ documentation for details.

Invite people to the team
-------------------------

You can invite members of your organization, as well as external guests such as vendors or project partners, to a Mattermost team. Anyone can invite people to the team, unless the system admin has `disabled this option </configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-account-creation>`__ or `restricted permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__ to do so. See the `about teams </welcome/about-teams.html>`__ documentation to learn more about team invitations.
