Channels are where you can communicate with your team about various topics or projects. The channels you're a member of and useful channel management tools are available in the channel sidebar to the left. 

See our `Mattermost Channels <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/channels.html>`__ documentation for details on the many ways you can use Channels to enable team collaboration.

Channels and direct messages
----------------------------

Everyone who joins a Mattermost workspace is automatically added to two default channels: **Town Square** and **Off-Topic**. See our `Channel Types <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/channel-types.html>`__ documentation for details.

- **Town Square** is great for your team-wide communications, such as announcements.
- **Off-Topic** is great for fun, social, non-work-related conversations. 

Direct messages are private conversations between two people. 
Group messages are private conversations for small groups of up to seven people. 
Start a new direct or group message by selecting the **Plus** |plus| icon next to **Direct Messages** in the channel sidebar.

.. tip:: 
    Direct and group messages are also channels in Mattermost, so many of the `preferences available for channels <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/set-channel-preferences.html>`__ are also available for direct messages. 

Create and join channels
------------------------

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a **Globe** |globe| icon. Anyone on the team can join a public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are identified with a **Lock** |lock| icon. You must be invited to private channels by another channel member.

  :alt: Private channels are identified with a Lock icon.

To see all available public channels you can join, select the **Plus** |plus| icon at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**. Search for channels by name or scroll through the list. Select **Join** next to any channel to become a member of that channel.

.. tip:: 
    Select **Find Channel** in the channel sidebar to see a list of recently visited channels and to jump to specific channels quickly by name, including public and private channels, as well as all direct and group messages.

To create a new public or private channel, select the **Plus** |plus| icon, then select **Create New Channel**. Anyone can create new channels, unless the System Admin has `restricted permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__ to do so. See our `Create Channels <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/create-channels.html>`__ documentation for more information.

As your channel sidebar fills up with channels you've joined, you can organize your channels into categories based on how you work. See `Customize Your Channel Sidebar <https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ for details.

Invite people to the team
-------------------------

You can invite members of your organization, as well as external guests such as vendors or project partners, to a Mattermost team. Anyone can invite people to the team, unless the System Admin has `disabled this option <https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-account-creation>`__ or `restricted permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__ to do so. 

To invite people to a team, select the **Plus** |plus| icon, then select **Invite People**. 

- For existing Mattermost users, enter usernames, then select **Member**. An invitation to join the team is sent as a direct message.
- For new Mattermost users or guests, enter email addresses, then select **Guest**. You must specify the channels the guest can access. 

.. tip:: 
    To extend an invitation to a larger group of people, you can share a team invitation link rather than sending individual invitations. Select the **Plus** |plus| icon, then select **Invite People**, then copy the invite link to your clipboard.

All email invitations contain a single-use link that expires after 48 hours. System Admins can also invalidate all active invitation links. See our `Invite people to teams <https://docs.mattermost.com/welcome/about-teams.html#invite-people-to-teams>`__ documemtation for details on inviting people to your Mattermost workspace.

Send messages
-------------

Enter your message in the text field, then press ENTER to send the message. Your messages can also include images and file attachments.

- Copy and paste images or drag-and-drop image files into the text field to add them to your message.
- Select the **Attachment** |attachment| icon to the right of the text field to attach documents or other files to your message.
