Using the Mattermost Desktop App, you can connect to multiple Mattermost servers from a single interface.

    The **Server** list is located in the top left corner of the window and displays all servers available in your Desktop App environment. Drag to reorder the servers in the list. You can also navigate the server options using `keyboard shortcuts <https://docs.mattermost.com/welcome/keyboard-shortcuts.html>`__. From the **Server** list, you can add, edit, and remove servers.
    
    **Add a server**

    2. Enter the server name as it will appear in the Desktop App.
    3. Enter the server URL. Server URLs must begin with either ``http://`` or ``https://``.

       .. tip::

        Can't find your Mattermost server URL? Ask your company’s IT department or your Mattermost System Admin for your organization’s **Mattermost Site URL**. It’ll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.

    4. Select **Add**.
