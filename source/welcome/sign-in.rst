You'll receive link to access Mattermost from your Mattermost System Admin or through an email invitation. Once you have your organization's Mattermost link, navigate to that URL in a browser, then enter your user credentials.

.. tip::
  - We recommend bookmarking the Mattermost URL so signing in to Mattermost is easy in the future.
  - Can't find your Mattermost link? Ask your company's IT department or your Mattermost System Admin for your organization's **Mattermost Site URL**. It'll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.

After signing in, the team that appears first on your team sidebar will open. If you have not joined a team, the Team Selection page opens where you can view a list of teams that you can join.

If you've forgotten your password, you can reset on the sign-in screen by selecting **I forgot my password**, or by contacting your System Admin for help.

Email address or username

When enabled by your System Admin, you can sign in with the username or email address used to create your account.
