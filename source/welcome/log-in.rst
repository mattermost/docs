=====================

  :start-after: :nosearch:

You'll receive link to access Mattermost from your Mattermost System Admin or through an email invitation. Once you have your organization's Mattermost link, navigate to that URL in a web browser, the `Desktop App <https://docs.mattermost.com/install/desktop-app-install.html>`__, or the `Mobile App <https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/use-prebuilt-mobile-apps.html>`__, then enter your user credentials to log into Mattermost.

.. tip::
  - We recommend bookmarking the Mattermost URL in your browser of choice so logging into Mattermost is easy in the future.
  - Can't find your Mattermost link? Ask your company's IT department or your Mattermost System Admin for your organization's **Mattermost Site URL**. It'll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.
  - Mattermost Cloud customers can log into their Cloud workspaces from the [Cloud Workspace Connection](https://customers.mattermost.com/cloud/connect-workspace) page by specifying their company or domain name.

After logging in, the team that appears first on your team sidebar opens. If you have not joined a team, the Team Selection page opens where you can view a list of teams that you can join.
