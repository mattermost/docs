It's also possible to create your own `Custom Emoji <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/custom-emoji.html>`__ if the emoji you want to use doesn't exist.

Custom Emoji
-------------
  
You can create Custom Emojis which are available to everyone on your Mattermost server. 
  
To create and find Custom Emojis, open the **Main Menu** at the top right of the channels sidebar and select **Custom Emoji**.
  
.. note::

  If you can't see the **Custom Emoji** option in the menu, then your Mattermost System Admin may have restricted access to certain users. Contact your Mattermost System Admin for help.
