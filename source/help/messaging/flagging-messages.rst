Saving Messages
---------------

Saving a message helps you mark messages for follow up. Your saved messages are personal, and can't be seen by other users. There's no limit to the number of posts you can save.

One way we like to use saved messages is to mark messages we want to respond to later. It's useful when someone asks for something that requires work. We save the post, keep doing what we're doing, and then go back to our list of **Saved Posts**. After the work is completed, we can reply back to the post and remove it from the list.
