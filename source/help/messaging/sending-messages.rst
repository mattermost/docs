Sending Messages
================

Messages are composed in the center pane and reply messages are composed in the right-hand sidebar. Depending on your system configuration, you can edit and delete messages after they are sent. You can also generate and share links to any message in Mattermost.

Sending a Message
-----------------

Write a message by typing into the text input box, then press **ENTER** to send it. Use **SHIFT+ENTER** to create a new line without sending a message. To send messages by pressing **CTRL+ENTER**, go to **Main Menu > Account Settings > Send messages on Ctrl + Enter**.

Replying to a Message
---------------------

Reply to messages to keep conversations organized in threads. Click the reply icon next to any message text to open the right-hand sidebar where you can compose and send your reply. Replies are indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message.

When composing a reply in the right-hand sidebar, click the expand/collapse icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar to make things easier to read.

Editing a Message
-----------------

Edit a message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to any message that youâ€™ve sent, then click **Edit**. Your System Admin may disable the **Edit** feature or set a time limit before messages become uneditable.

.. note::
  Message edits do not trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications, or notification sounds.

Deleting a Message
------------------

Delete a message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to any message that you've sent, then click **Delete**. The **Delete** option may be disabled by your System Admin.

Linking to a Message
--------------------

The permalink feature creates a link to any message. Get the permalink to any message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to a message, then click **Permalink > Copy Link**. Sharing this link lets other users view the linked message in the Message Archives. If the link is to a message in a Public Channel, any user of the team can see the message. If the link is to a message in a Private Group, only other users in the group can see the message.

.. tip::
  The timestamp that appears beside the username of any message is also a permalink.
