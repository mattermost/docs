Messages
================
 
Sending messages and replying to messages are important ways to keep conversations active with your team. You can edit and delete messages after you have sent them. You can also share links to any message in Mattermost.

Sending Messages
-----------------

Write a message by typing into the text input box, then press ENTER to send it. Use SHIFT+ENTER to create a new line without sending a message. To send messages by pressing CTRL+ENTER, go to **Main Menu > Account Settings > Advanced > Send messages on Ctrl + Enter > Edit**.

Replying to Messages
---------------------

Click the reply link (arrow icon) next to any message. This keeps conversations organized in threads. Replies are indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message.

Clicking the reply link will open a sidebar on the right-hand side. To expand the right-hand sidebar to its full width, click the expand/shrink icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar. To shrink the right-hand sidebar to its original width, click the same expand/shrink icon.

Editing Messages
-----------------

Click the **[...]** link next to a message that you have sent, then click **Edit**.

.. note::
  Message edits do not trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications, or notification sounds.

Your System Admin `can disable the **Edit** feature or set a time limit <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html?highlight=config%20settings#allow-users-to-edit-their-messages>`_ before messages become uneditable, available in Mattermost Enterprise Edition E10 and E20.

Deleting Messages
------------------

Click the **[...]** link next to a message that you have sent, then click **Delete**.

Your System Admin can `disable the **Delete** feature <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html?highlight=config%20settings#allow-which-users-to-delete-messages>`_, available in Mattermost Enterprise Edition E10 and E20.

Linking to Messages
--------------------

Click the **[...]** link next to a message, then click **Permalink > Copy Link**.

If the link is to a message in a Public Channel, any member of the team can see the message. If the link is to a message in a Private Group, only members in that group can see the message.

.. tip::
  The timestamp that appears beside the username of any message is also a permalink.
