# Attaching Files
_____

## Attachment Methods
Attach a file by drag and drop or by clicking the attachment icon in the message input box. 

#### Drag and Drop
Upload a file or selection of files by dragging the files from your computer into the RHS or center pane. Dragging and dropping attaches the files to the message input box, then you can optionally type a message and press **ENTER** to post.

#### Attachment Icon
Alternatively, upload files by clicking the grey paperclip icon inside the message input box. This opens up your system file viewer where you can navigate to the desired files and then click **Open** to upload the files to the message input box. Optionally type a message and then press **ENTER** to post.

## File Previewer
Mattermost has a built in file previewer that is used to view media, download files and share public links. Click the thumbnail of an attached file to open it in the file previewer.


#### Sharing Public Links
Public links allow you to share file attachments with people outside your Mattermost team. Open the file previewer by clicking on the thumbnail of an attachment, then click **Get Public Link**. This opens a dialog box with a link to copy. When the link is shared and opened by another user, the file will automatically download.

If **Get Public Link** is not visible in the file previewer, then it has been disabled through the System Console. Please contact your system administrator to have it enabled if necessary.


#### Downloading Files
Download an attached file by clicking the download icon next to the file thumbnail or by opening the file previewer and clicking **Download**.

#### Supported Media Types
If you are trying to preview a media type that is not supported, the file previewer will open a standard media attachment icon. Supported media formats depend heavily on your browser and operating system, but the following formats are supported by Mattermost on most browsers:

Images: BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG    
Video: MP4    
Audio: MP3, M4A    

Document preview (PDF, Word, Excel, PPT) is not yet supported.

## File Size Limitations
Mattermost supports a maximum of five attached files per post, each with a maximum file size of 50Mb.
