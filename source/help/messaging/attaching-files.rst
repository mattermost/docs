Sharing Files
===============

With attachments, you can share additional information that will help your 
team to visually understand your ideas. Sharing videos, voice recordings,
screenshots, and photos will make your messages more effective and clear.

How to Attach Files

You can attach files in the following ways:

-  Use the attachment icon - click the paperclip icon inside the message input box

File Previewer
--------------
Mattermost has a built-in file previewer that you can use to:

-  Download files
-  Share public links

Click the thumbnail of an attached file to open it in the file previewer.

Downloading Files
