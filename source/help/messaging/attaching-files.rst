Sharing Files
===============

With attachments, you can share additional information that will help your 
team to visually understand your ideas. Sharing videos, voice recordings,
screenshots, and photos will make your messages more effective and clear.

How to Attach Files
------------------
You can attach files in the following ways:

-  Use the attachment icon - click the paperclip icon inside the message input box
-  Drag and Drop
-  Paste from the clipboard - this feature is supported in Chrome and Edge browsers

File Previewer
--------------
Mattermost has a built-in file previewer that you can use to:

-  Download files
-  Share public links
-  View media

Click the thumbnail of an attached file to open it in the file previewer.

Downloading Files

You can download an attached file by clicking the download icon next to the file 
thumbnail.

Sharing Public Links

Public URLs allow you to share attachments with anyone outside the Mattermost 
system. To share an attachment, click the thumbnail of an attachment, then click
**Get Public Link**.

.. Tip::
If **Get Public Link** is not visible in the file previewer
and you prefer that the feature is enabled, you can request your System
