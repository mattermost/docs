# Sending Messages
==================

## Message Types
Reply to posts to keep conversations organized in threads.

#### Posts
Posts can be considered parent messages. They are the messages that often start a thread of replies. Posts can be written and sent from the text input box at the bottom of the center pane.

#### Replies
Reply to a message by clicking the reply icon next to any message text. This action opens the right-hand sidebar (RHS) where you can see the message thread, then compose and send your reply. Replies are indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent post.

When composing a reply in the right-hand sidebar, click the expand/collapse icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar to make things easier to read.

## Posting a Message
Write a message by typing into the text input box, then press ENTER to send it. Use SHIFT+ENTER to create a new line without sending a message. To send messages by pressing CTRL+ENTER go to **Main Menu > Account Settings > Send messages on CTRL+ENTER**.

## Editing a Message
Edit a message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to any message that you’ve sent, then click **Edit**. When you're done editing, press ENTER to save the changes. Message edits do not trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications or notification sounds.

## Deleting a message
Delete a message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to any message that you've sent, then click **Delete**. System and Team Admins can delete any message on their system or team.

## Linking to a message
The **Permalink** feature creates a link to any message. Get the permalink to any message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to the a message  > **Permalink** > **Copy Link**. Sharing this link will let other users view the linked message in the Message Archives. If the link is to a message in a public channel, any user of the team can see the message. If the link is to a message in a private channel, only other users in the private channel can see the message.
