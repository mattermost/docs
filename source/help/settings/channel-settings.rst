**Notification Preferences > Mute channel**.

Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, you will recieve mention notifications for any uses of @channel, @all or @here in a channel. When enabled, the channel will ignore mention notifications for channel wide mentions. Any messages containing @channel, @all or @here will still mark the channel unread, unless channel mute is enabled.

Channel Header
--------------

In the channel menu, select **Edit Channel Header** to change the text that appears next to the channel name at the top of the screen.

Adding links to the Channel Header

Frequently-used links to documents, video calls, or other sites can be added to the channel header using markdown.
