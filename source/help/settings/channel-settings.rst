Channel Notification Preferences

**Notification Preferences > Mark Channel Unread > Only for mention**.


Channel Header

Select **Edit Channel Header** to change the text that appears next to
the channel name at the top of the screen. It can be used to summarize
the channel topic or provide links to frequently accessed documents. Any

permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-public-channel-management-permissions-for>`__.
