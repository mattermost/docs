Channel Header
--------------

In the channel menu, select **Edit Channel Header** to change the text that appears next to
the channel name at the top of the screen. It can be used to summarize
the channel topic or provide links to frequently accessed documents. Any
channel member can edit this setting, unless the System Administrator
has `restricted the permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-public-channel-renaming-for>`__.

Channel Purpose
---------------

In the channel menu, select **Edit Channel Purpose** to change the text that appears in the
*More…* menu for channels. The channel purpose is usually a short
description that helps others decide whether to join the channel. Any
channel member can edit this setting, unless the System Administrator
has `restricted the permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-public-channel-renaming-for>`__.

Channel Name
------------

In the channel menu, select **Rename Channel** to change the channel name or handle. Changing the channel handle changes the channel URL. Any channel
member can edit this setting, unless the System Administrator has
`restricted the permissions <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-public-channel-renaming-for>`__.
