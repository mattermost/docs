# Theme Colors
_____
The colors of the Mattermost user interface are customizable in **Account Settings** > **Display** > **Theme**. You can import your theme colors from Slack, customize the colors yourself, or choose from four standard themes designed by the Mattermost team.

In Enterprise Edition, if you belong to multiple teams, you can choose to apply any changes across teams by selecting "Apply New Theme to All Teams" before saving. If this is not selected, any changes are only applied to the current team. 

## Standard Themes
Select **Theme Colors** to choose from four standard themes designed by the Mattermost team. To make custom adjustments on the four standard theme colours, click a standard theme and then select **Custom Theme** to load the standard theme into the custom theme color selectors.

## Import Theme from Slack
To import a theme, go to **Preferences > Sidebar Theme** from within Slack, open the custom theme option, copy the theme color vector and then paste it into the *Input Slack Theme* input box in Mattermost. Any theme settings that are not customizable in Slack will default to the “Mattermost” standard theme settings.

## Custom Themes
Observe a live preview as you customize theme colors and then click **Save** to confirm your changes. Discard your changes by exiting the settings modal and clicking **Yes, Discard**.
