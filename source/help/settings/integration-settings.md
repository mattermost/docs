## Integrations 
___ 

Settings for integrations are accessible from the **Main Menu** by clicking the three dots at the top of the channels pane. Clicking **Integrations** opens a page where you can view and configure incoming webhooks, outgoing webhooks, and slash commands for your team. If you cannot see an **Integrations** option, then your System Administrator may have only given Administrators access. 

#### Incoming Webhooks
Incoming webhooks from external integrations can post messages to Mattermost in public channels or private groups. Learn more about setting up incoming webhooks on our [documentation page](http://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html).


#### Outgoing Webhooks
Outgoing webhooks use trigger words to fire new message events to external integrations. For security reasons, outgoing webhooks are only available in public channels. Learn more about setting up outgoing webhooks on our [documentation page](http://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-outgoing.html).

#### Slash Commands
Slash commands allow users to interact with external applications by typing `/` followed by a command. See [executing slash commands](http://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/executing-commands.html) for a list of built-in commands. Learn more about setting up custom slash commands on our [documentation page](http://docs.mattermost.com/developer/slash-commands.html).
