Account Settings
================

--------------

Account Settings is accessible from the **Main Menu** by clicking the three horizontal lines (or hamburger menu) at the top of the channels pane. From here, you can configure your profile settings, notification preferences, integrations, theme settings, and display options.

General
-------

Settings to configure name, username, nickname, email and profile picture.

Full Name
~~~~~~~~~

Full names appear in the Direct Messages member list and team management modal. By default, you will receive mention notifications when someone types your first name. Entering a full name is optional.

Username
~~~~~~~~

Usernames are unique identifiers appearing next to all posts. Pick something easy for teammates to recognize and recall. By default, you will receive mention notifications when someone types your username. In order to maintain message integrity, changing your username does not update @mentions in messages already posted. 

Nickname
~~~~~~~~

Nicknames appear in the Direct Messages member list and team management modal. You will not receive mention notifications when someone types your nickname unless you add it to the *Words That Trigger Mentions* in **Account Settings > Notifications**.

Position
~~~~~~~~~

Position can be used to describe your role or job title. It appears in the profile popup that shows up when you click a user's name in the center channel or right-hand sidebar.

Email
~~~~~

Email is used for sign-in, notifications, and password reset. Email requires verification if changed. If you are signing in using a single sign-on service, the email field is not editable and you will receive email notifications to the email you used to sign up to your SSO service.

Profile Picture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profile pictures appear next to all posts and in the top of the channels pane next to your name. Change your profile picture by clicking **Select** and then choosing a picture. For best results, choose an image that is at least 128 x 128 pixels in size. The GIF format is not supported.

Security
--------

Settings to configure your password, view access history, and view or logout of active sessions.

Password
~~~~~~~~

You may change your password if you’ve logged in by email. If you are signing in using a single sign-on service, the password field is not editable, and you must access your SSO service’s account settings to update your password.

Multi-factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When this option is available you can require a phone-based passcode in addition to your password for sign-in.

To enable, download Google Authenticator from `iTunes <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8>`__ or `Google Play <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en>`__ for your phone, then:

1. Click the **Add MFA to your account** button.
2. Use Google Authenticator to scan the QR code that appears.
3. Type in the Token generated by Google Authenticator and click **Save**.

In future, you will be asked to enter a passcode from Google Authenticator in addition to your password on login.

If you are unable to scan the QR code, you can:

1. Click the **Add MFA to your account** button, and you should see a ``Secret Key`` below the QR code.
2. Open Google Authenticator.
3. Click the **+** button, and select **Manual Entry**.
4. Enter an account name.
5. Enter the ``Secret Key`` from Mattermost into the ``Key`` field in Google Authenticator, and save.
6. In Mattermost, type the token generated by Google Authenticator and click **Save**.

Sign-in Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows you to switch your sign-in method from email/password to a single sign-on option, and back again.

For example, if AD/LDAP single sign-on is enabled, users can click a "Switch to using AD/LDAP" button and the enter their AD/LDAP credentials to switch sign-in over to AD/LDAP. They also need to enter the password for their email account to verify their existing credentials. Following the change, users receive an email to confirm the action.

View Access History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access History displays a chronological list of the last 20 login and logout attempts, channel creations and deletions, account settings changes, or channel setting modifications made on your account. The details of the Session ID (unique identifier for each Mattermost browser session) and IP Address of the action is recorded for audit log purposes.

View and Logout of Active Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sessions are created when you log in with your email and password to a new browser on a device. Sessions let you use Mattermost for up to 30 days without having to log in again. Click **Logout** on an active session if you want to revoke automatic login privileges for a specific browser or device. Click **More Info** to view details on browser and operating system.

Notifications
-------------

Settings to configure desktop notifications, desktop notification sounds, email notifications, and words that trigger mentions.

Desktop Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Desktop notifications appear in the corner of your main monitor when there is activity in Mattermost.

When `Desktop App <https://about.mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`__ notifications are set to "Only for mentions and direct messages", an empty red circle is displayed over the upper right corner of the Mattermost dock icon when any message without an at-mention is received. A solid red circle with a post count is displayed when a message with an at-mention is received.

Send Desktop Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose what activity triggers a desktop notification. This setting applies globally, but this preference is customizable for each channel from the channel name drop-down menu. Desktop notifications are available on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

Notification Sound
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notification sounds fire for any activity that would trigger a desktop notification. Notification sounds are available on IE11, Edge, Safari and Chrome.

Notification Duration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Removed in June 16th, 2018 release*

In Mattermost v5.0 and later, desktop notifications will stay onscreen for 5 seconds when supported by the browser and operating system.

Email Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email notifications are sent for mentions and direct messages after you’ve been offline for more than 60 seconds or away from Mattermost for more than 5 minutes. Change the email where notifications are sent in **Account Settings > General > Email**.

If your System Administrator has enabled **Email Batching**, you will have additional options under this settings to select how often email notifications will be sent. All notifications received over this time period are combined and sent in a single email.

Send Mobile Push Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Push notifications can be sent to your mobile device if you have the Android or iOS app installed. You can choose the type of activity that will send a notification. By default, push notifications are sent "For mentions and direct messages". If push notifications are sent "Never", the Mattermost setting to trigger push notifications depending on your status is hidden. If your System Administrator has not set up push notifications, this setting will be disabled.

If you are actively viewing a channel (public, private, or direct message) on desktop or web, no push notifications will be sent for that channel. If a notification is viewed on desktop or web, the lockscreen notification will clear on Android, and on iOS the badge on the Mattermost app icon will decrement accordingly.

Trigger Mobile Push Notifications When
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also choose when to send push notifications depending on your status. By default, push notifications are sent if your status is "Away or offline". If "Send Mobile Push Notifications" is set as "Never", this setting is hidden. If your System Administrator has not set up push notifications, this setting will be disabled.

Words That Trigger Mentions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, you receive notifications when someone posts a message that contains your non-case sensitive username or @username. You also receive notifications when someone uses the @channel, @all, and @here mentions. You can customize the words that trigger mentions by typing them into the input box. This is useful if you want to be notified of all posts on a certain topic, for example, "marketing".

Reply Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to **Words that Trigger Mentions**, this setting allows you to receive mention notifications when someone replies to a thread that you started or participated in. You are considered to start a thread when you post a message to which other members of your team reply. You are considered to participate in a thread when you post a message using the `reply button <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/messaging-basics.html#messaging-basics>`__ in an already existing thread.

Automatic Direct Message Replies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Set a custom message that will be automatically sent in response to Direct Messages. Mentions in Public and Private Channels will not trigger the automated reply. Enabling Automatic Replies sets your status to Out of Office and disables email and push notifications. This setting is experimental and `must be enabled by your System Admin <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html?highlight=config%20settings#enable-automatic-replies-experimental>`__.

Theme
~~~~~

Select **Theme Colors** to select from four standard themes designed by the Mattermost team. To make custom adjustments on the four standard theme colours, click a standard theme and then select **Custom Theme** to load the standard theme into the custom theme color selectors.

Select **Custom Theme** to customize your theme colors and share them with others by copying and pasting theme vectors into the input box. Observe a live preview as you customize theme colors and then click **Save** to confirm your changes. Discard your changes by clicking **Cancel** or by exiting the settings modal and clicking **Yes, Discard**.

In Enterprise Edition, if you belong to multiple teams, you can optionally select the checkbox "Apply new theme to all my teams" to have the theme show up across teams. Otherwise, the changes will only apply to the current team.

Learn more about the custom theme color selectors `here <http://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/theme-colors.html#custom-themes>`__.

Select **Import theme colors from Slack** to import a Slack theme. In Slack, go to **Preferences > Sidebar Theme** and open the custom theme option. From there, copy the theme color vector and then paste it into the *Input Slack Theme* input box in Mattermost. Any theme settings that are not customizable in Slack will default to the “Mattermost” standard theme settings.

This setting is experimental and can be disabled from **Account Settings** -> **Sidebar** -> **Group Unreads Channels**.
