Custom Emoji
------------------

Settings for Custom Emoji are accessible from the **Main Menu** by clicking the three dots at the top of the channels sidebar. Clicking **Custom Emoji** opens a page where you can view existing Custom Emojis and create new ones.

To create a Custom Emoji:

1. Click on the three dots at the top of the channels sidebar to open the **Main Menu**.
2. Select **Custom Emoji**.
3. Click **Add Custom Emoji**.
4. Enter a name for your Custom Emoji. (This is the name that will show up in the emoji autocomplete).
5. Click **Select**, and choose what image to use for the emoji.
6. Click **Save**.

Small, square pictures work best when selecting an image. The file can be any JPG, GIF, or PNG less than 64KB in size with dimensions up to 128x128 pixels.

After saving, your emoji will show up in the list of Custom Emoji. To add your Custom Emoji to a message, simply type ":" followed by your emoji name to bring it up in the emoji autocomplete. Other users on the site will also be able to see your emoji in the autocomplete, and will be able to use it in their own messages.

Note: If you cannot see the **Custom Emoji** option in the menu, then your System Administrator may have restricted access to certain users. Contact your System Administrator for help.
