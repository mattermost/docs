# Account Settings
___
Account Settings is accessible from the **Main Menu** by clicking the three dots at the top of the channels pane. From here, you can configure your profile settings, notification preferences, integrations, theme settings, and display options.

## General
Settings to configure name, username, nickname, email and profile picture.

#### Full Name
Full names appear in the Direct Messages member list and team management modal. By default, you will receive mention notifications when someone types your first name. Entering a full name is optional.

#### Username
Usernames are unique identifers appearing next to all posts. Pick something easy for teammates to recognize and recall. By default, you will receive mention notifications when someone types your username. In order to maintain message integrity, changing your username does not update @mentions in messages already posted.  

#### Nickname
Nicknames appear in the Direct Messages member list and team management modal. You will not receive mention notifications when someone types your nickname unless you add it to the *Words That Trigger Mentions* in **Account Settings > Notifications**.

#### Email
Email is used for sign-in, notifications, and password reset. Email requires verification if changed. If you are signing in using a single sign-on service, the email field is not editable and you will receive email notifications to the email you used to sign up to your SSO service.

#### Profile Picture
Profile pictures appear next to all posts and in the top of the channels pane next to your name. All users have a generic profile picture when they sign up for an account. Edit your profile picture by clicking **Select** and then choosing a picture in either JPG or PNG format that’s at least 128px wide and 128px high. For best results, choose an image that is square with the subject of interest centered. If you edit your profile picture, all past posts will appear with the new picture.

## Security
Settings to configure your password, view access history, and view or logout of active sessions.

#### Password
You may change your password if you’ve logged in by email. If you are signing in using a single sign-on service, the password field is not editable, and you must access your SSO service’s account settings to update your password.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication 
When this option is available you can requires a phone-based passcode in addition your password for sign-in. 

To enable, download Google Authenticator from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) for your phone, then 

1. Click the **Add MFA to your account** button above 
2. Use Google Authenticator to scan the QR code that appears. 
3. Type in the Token generated by Google Authenticator and click **Save**. 

In future, you will be asked to enter a passcode from Google Authenticator in addition to your password on login.

#### Sign-in Method 

This option allows you to switch your sign-in method from email/password to a single-sign-on option, and back again. 

For example, if LDAP single-sign-on is enabled, users can click a "Switch to using LDAP" button and the enter their LDAP credentials to switch sign-in over to LDAP. They also need to enter the password for their email account to verify their existing credentials. Following the change, users receive an email to confirm the action. 

#### View Access History
Access History displays a chronological list of the last 20 login and logout attempts, channel creations and deletions, account settings changes, or channel setting modifications made on your account. The details of the Session ID (unique identifier for each Mattermost browser session) and IP Address of the action is recorded for audit log purposes.

#### View and Logout of Active Sessions
Sessions are created when you log in with your email and password to a new browser on a device. Sessions let you use Mattermost for up to 30 days without having to log in again. Click **Logout** on an active session if you want to revoke automatic login privileges for a specific browser or device. Click **More Info** to view details on browser and operating system.

Settings to configure desktop notifications, desktop notification sounds, email notifications, and words that trigger mentions.

#### Desktop Notifications
Desktop notifications appear at the bottom right corner of your main monitor when there is activity in Mattermost. 

##### Send Desktop Notifications

Choose what activity triggers a desktop notification. This setting applies globally, but this preference is customizable for each channel from the channel name drop-down menu. Desktop notifications are available on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

##### Notification Sound

If your System Administrator has enabled **Email Batching**, you will have additional options under this settings to select how often email notifications will be sent. All notifications received over this time period are combined and sent in a single email. 

#### Mobile Push Notifications
Push notifications are sent to your mobile device if you have the Android or iOS app installed. They are sent even if you are online, similar to desktop notifications. By default, push notifications are sent "For mentions and direct messages". If your System Administrator has not set up push notifications, this setting will be disabled.

#### Words That Trigger Mentions
By default, you will receive mention notifications from your non-case sensitive username, mentioned @username and @channel. Customize the words that trigger mentions by typing them in the input box. This is useful if you want to be notified of all posts on a certain topic, for example, “marketing”.

In addition to **Words that Trigger Mentions**, this setting allows you to receive mention notifications when someone replies to a thread that you started or participated in. You are considered to start a thread when you post a message to which other members of your team reply. You are considered to participate in a thread when you post a message using the [reply button](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/messaging-basics.html#messaging-basics) in an already existing thread.
