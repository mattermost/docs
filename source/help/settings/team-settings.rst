Team Settings
-------------

--------------

This documentation refers to Mattermost v3.0. For v2.2, see `archived
documentation <http://docs.mattermost.com/archives/docs-v2.2.html#team-settings>`__.

The Team Settings menu offers Team Administrators and System
Administrators the ability to adjust settings applied to a specific
team.

The following settings are found in a Team Site from the **Three-Dot**
menu at the top of the left sidebar under **Team Settings**.

General
~~~~~~~

General settings under the **Team Settings** > **General** configure how
a team is displayed to users.

Team Name
^^^^^^^^^

Your **Team Name** is displayed on the sign-in page, and in the top of
the left-hand sidebar for your team.

You can enter a name up to 22 characters in length. The length of team
names is limited to ensure readability.

Allow anyone to join this team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a user logs in to the site, they are shown a Team Selection page.
Any team with **Allow anyone to join this team** option set to **Yes**
will show up on this page under "Open teams you can join".

Invite Code
^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Invite Code** is used as part of the URL in the team invitation
link retrieved from the **Main Menu** > **Get Team Invite Link**. Click
**Re-Generate** and then **Save** to generate a new team invitation link
and invalidate the previous link.

Import
~~~~~~

Import from Slack (Beta)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note: As a proprietary SaaS service, Slack is able to change its export
format quickly and without notice. If you encounter issues not mentioned
in the documentation below, please alert the product team by `filing an
issue <https://github.com/mattermost/platform/issues>`__.*

The Slack Import feature in Mattermost is in "Beta" and focus is on
supporting migration of teams of less than 100 registered users. To use:

#. Generate a Slack "Export" file from **Slack > Team Settings >
   Import/Export Data > Export > Start Export**.

#. In Mattermost go to **Team Settings > Import > Import from Slack**.
   *Team Administrator* or *System Administrator* role is required to
   access this menu option.

#. Click **Select file** to upload Slack export file and click
   **Import**.

#. Emails and usernames from Slack are used to create new Mattermost
   accounts.

#. Slack users can activate their new Mattermost accounts by using
   Mattermost's Password Reset screen with their email addresses from
   Slack to set new passwords for their Mattermost accounts.

#. Once logged in, the Mattermost users will have access to previous
   Slack messages in the public channels imported from Slack.

**It is highly recommended that you test Slack import before applying it
to an instance intended for production.** If you use Docker, you can
spin up a test instance in one line
(``docker run --name mattermost-dev -d --publish 8065:80 mattermost/platform``).
If you don't use Docker, there are `step-by-step
instructions <http://docs.mattermost.com/install/docker-local-machine.html>`__
to install Mattermost in preview mode in less than 5 minutes.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Newly added markdown support in Slack's Posts 2.0 feature announced
   on September 28, 2015 is not yet supported.
-  Slack does not export files or images your team has stored in Slack's
   database. Mattermost will provide links to the location of your
   assets in Slack's web UI.
-  Slack does not export any content from private groups or direct
   messages that your team has stored in Slack's database.
-  In Beta, Slack accounts with usernames or email addresses identical
   to existing Mattermost accounts will not import. No pre-check or
   roll-back is currently offered.
