Configuring Notifications
=========================

Desktop, email, and mobile push notifications notify you of activity in Mattermost. When you join a team, Mattermost will notify you of messages directed at you, including when someone:

- Mentions you specifically with `@username`
- Sends you a Direct Message
- Mentions your username or first name in a channel
- Notifies a channel you're in using @channel or @all
- Uses any `keywords you've configured <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#words-that-trigger-mentions>`_ 

Desktop Notifications
-------------------------------------

Desktop notifications are pop-ups that appear in the corner of your main monitor when using Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, or the `Mattermost Desktop Apps <https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`_. You can change the default preference to trigger desktop notifications for all messages sent in channels you're a member of, or turn them off entirely. You can also choose what sound plays when a desktop notification is triggered on supported browsers and the Mattermost Desktop Apps.

-  Configure desktop notifications in **Account Settings > Notifications > Desktop Notifications > Send desktop notifications**, then choose your sound preference.
-  Configure desktop notifications in specific channels in the channel menu via **Notification Preferences > Send desktop notifications**.
- By default, all channels use the global setting configured in **Account Settings**.
   
**Not getting a desktop notification?** See our `FAQ to view the desktop notification flow chart <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/faq.html?#what-determines-if-a-desktop-notification-should-be-triggered>`_ and see what other factors influence if a notification should be triggered.

.. tip:: 

  Configure desktop notification sounds in **Account Settings > Notifications > Desktop notifications > Notification sounds**.

Email Notifications
-------------------------------------

By default, you'll get email notifications if you're not actively using Mattermost. You can change the default preference for email notifications to turn them off entirely.

Mobile Push Notifications
--------------------------------------------

Mobile push notifications appear on the lock screen of your mobile device if the Mattermost Android or iOS app is installed. By default, these notifications are triggered when you're not actively using Mattermost, but this is configurable. You can also change the default preference to trigger push notifications for all messages sent in channels you're a member of, or turn them off entirely.

-  Configure push notifications in **Account Settings > Notifications > Mobile push notifications > Send mobile push notifications**.
-  Configure when push notifications are sent depending on your availability in **Account Settings > Notifications > Mobile push notifications > Trigger push notifications when**.

Browser Tab Notifications
----------------------------------------

If Mattermost is open in a browser tab, the favicon updates to notify you of unread messages (\*) and a count of mentions or Direct Messages. Browser tab notifications are available on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari.

Muting a Channel
----------------------------------------

Channels in the sidebar are **bold** when there are unread messages in the channel and show a badge count if you are mentioned specifically. 

When you mute a channel, you do not receive any notifications (desktop, email, or push) for any mentions (whether they are channel-wide or directed at you). However, if you are mentioned while the channel is muted, the mention badge will be displayed in the sidebar with the channel displaying at reduced opacity.

To mute a channel, click on the channel name and select **Mute Channel**. To unmute it, click on the channel name and select **Unmute Channel**.

.. tip:: 

  Mentions are triggered by `selected keywords <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#words-that-trigger-mentions>`__. Learn more about `mentioning teammates <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/mentioning-teammates.html>`__.

Ignoring Mentions
-----------------

To turn off notifications for channel-wide mentions for @channel, @here, and @all, navigate to **Notification Preferences > Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all**. Choose **Edit**, select **On**, and then select **Save**. 

When this setting is on you will still receive notifications for direct mentions. 

**Note:** If you have muted a channel and also enabled **Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all** then you will not receive any notifications (whether they're direct or channel-wide). However, if you are directly mentioned in the muted channel a badge counter will be displayed in the sidebar. 

You can also view the `notifications flow charts <https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/faq.html?#notifications>`_ for more information about notification behavior in Mattermost.
