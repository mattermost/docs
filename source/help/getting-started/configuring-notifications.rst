Configuring Notifications
=========================

--------------

Notifications in Mattermost alert you to unread messages and mentions.

Unread Notifications
--------------------

Channel name bolding and mention jewels notify you if there’s been
activity in channels that you’re a member of since you were last online.
When a channel with unreads is opened, there is an unread messages
indicator placed at the location of the last read message.

Channel Bolding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unread messages in a channel are indicated by a bold channel name in the
left-hand-side (LHS). Clicking the channel name removes the bolding.

-  Change what activity triggers the channel bolding by clicking
   **Channel Menu** > **Notification Preferences** > **Mark Channel
   Unread**.

Mention Jewels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unread mentions in a channel are indicated by bold text and a mention
jewel next to the channel name in the LHS. Clicking the channel name
removes the bolding and mention jewel. You can always review your recent
mentions by clicking **@** next to the search box at the top of the
screen. Learn more about `mentioning

Email Notifications

   **Notifications** > **Email Notifications**.
-  Configure the email address where notifications are sent in **Account
   Settings** > **General** > **Email**

Desktop Notifications
---------------------

These are browser notifications that appear in the corner of your main
monitor. By default, these notifications are sent for all activity while
Mattermost is open. Desktop notifications are available on Firefox,
Safari, and Chrome.

   Settings** > **Notifications** > **Desktop Notifications** > **Send
   Desktop Notifications**.

   Menu** > **Notification Preferences** > **Send Desktop
   Notifications**. By default, all channels use the global setting
   configured in *Account Settings*.

Mobile Push Notifications
-------------------------

If the Mattermost Android or iOS app is installed, push notifications
can be sent to your mobile device. By default, these notifications are
sent for mentions in any channel or direct message channel that is not
being viewed on desktop.

-  Configure when push notifications are sent from **Account Settings**
   > **Notifications** > **Mobile Push Notifications** > **Send mobile
   push notifications**.
-  Configure when push notifications are sent depending on your status
   from **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Mobile Push
   Notifications** > **Trigger push notifications when**.

Notification Sounds
-------------------

A notification sound plays for all activity that would fire a desktop
notification. Notification sounds are available on Safari, Chrome and
Edge.

-  Turn notification sounds On or Off in **Account Settings** >
   **Notifications** > **Desktop Notification Sounds**.
-  Configure desktop notification triggers, sounds and duration in
   **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Desktop Notifications**.
-  Configure channel specific desktop notifications from **Channel
   Menu** > **Notification Preferences** > **Send Desktop
   Notifications**. By default, all channels use the global setting
   configured in *Account Settings*.

Browser Tab Notifications
-------------------------

The browser tab favicon updates to inform you of unread messages and
mentions if Mattermost is open in an inactive browser tab. Browser tab
notifications are available on Firefox and Chrome.

-  Unread messages are denoted by an asterisk (\*) next to a black
   Mattermost icon.
-  Mentions are denoted by a red Mattermost icon with the number of
   unread mentions shown in brackets.
