Creating Teams
==============

New teams can be created if the System Admin has **Enable Team Creation** set to true from the System Console.

Methods to Create a Team
------------------------

If team creation is enabled by the System Admin, teams can be created from the team sidebar or Main Menu. The person who creates a team will automatically be given the Team Admin role for that team.

Team Sidebar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you belong to more than one team, a team sidebar will appear left of your channel list on the left-hand sidebar.

Click the "+" icon at the bottom of the team sidebar, then click **Create a new team** on the team selection page, which guides you through the rest of the setup steps. If this option is not visible on the web page, then the System Admin has disabled team creation.

If you have no other teams to join, clicking the "+" icon brings you directly to the team creation page if team creation is enabled.

Main Menu
~~~~~~~~~~
From your current Mattermost team, click on the **Main Menu** > **Create a New Team**. If this option is not visible in the menu, then the System Admin has disabled team creation.

There are a few details and restrictions to consider when selecting a team name and team URL.
