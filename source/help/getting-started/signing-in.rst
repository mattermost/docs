Signing In
==========

To sign in, navigate to the Mattermost sign-in screen. You can `get the URL of the sign-in screen <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/access-your-workspace.html>`__ from your System Admin or from an email invitation.

.. tip::
  We recommend bookmarking the Mattermost URL provided by your System Admin or through an email invitation so signing in to Mattermost is easy in the future.

After signing in, the team that appears first on your team sidebar will open. If you have not joined a team, the Team Selection page opens where you can view a list of teams that you can join.
