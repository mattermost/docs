Signing In
==========

To sign in, navigate to the Mattermost sign-in screen. You can get the URL of the sign-in screen from your System Admin or in an invitation email. We recommend bookmarking the site so you can easily find it again.

After signing in, the team that appears first on your team sidebar will open. If you have not joined a team, the Team Selection page opens where you can view a list of teams that you can join.
