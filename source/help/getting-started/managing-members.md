## Inviting Team Members

If user creation is enabled by the System Admin, there are two methods to invite new members after team creation: sending direct invites and sharing the team invite link.

#### Direct Invites  

Direct invites are invitation emails sent from your teams server directly to the invited members email address. A link within the invitation email directs the users to an account creation page.

From the three dot **Main Menu** in the Mattermost header, select **Invite New Member**. Enter a new members email address along with their first and last name. Click **Add another** to send more direct invites from the same dialog.

#### Team Invite Link  

The team invite link is a unique URL that directs users to an account creation page for your team. Your team invite link can be used by any number of users and does not change unless it is re-generated by a Team or System Admin via **Team Settings** > **General** > **Invite Code**. For example, the team invite link can be included in a company wide email to invite all employees to join a Mattermost team.

From the three dot **Main Menu** in the Mattermost header, select *Get Team Invite Link**. Copy the link and share it with users you'd like to invite to the team.

## User Roles  

There are four types of user roles with different permission levels in Mattermost: System Admins, Team Admins, Members and Inactive accounts. The following user roles are assigned from the **Manage Members** menu option in the team site main menu. 

#### Member 

This is the default role given to end users who join the system. Members have basic permissions to use the Mattermost team site.

#### Inactive 

This status is given to users whose accounts are marked inactive. These users can no longer log into the system. 

Because Mattermost is designed as a system-of-record, there is not an option to delete users from the Mattermost system, as such an operation could compromise the integrity of message archives. 

#### System Admin

The System Administrator is typically a member of the IT staff and has the follow privileges: 

- Access to the System Console from the main menu in any team site. 
- Change any setting on the Mattermost server available in the System Console.
- Promote and demote other users to and from the System Admin role.
- This role also has all the privileges of the Team Administrator as described below

The first user added to a newly installed Mattermost system is assigned the System Admin role. 

#### Team Admin 

The Team Administrator is typically a non-technical end user and has the following privileges: 

- Access to the "Team Settings" menu from the team site main menu
- Ability to change the team name and import data from Slack export files
- Access to the "Manage Members" menu and change user roles to the levels of Team Administrator, Member and Inactive
