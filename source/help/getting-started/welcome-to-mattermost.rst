To understand how Mattermost works, below is a list of the main features of Mattermost with instructions on how to use them:

- Teams
- Channels
- Messages
- Search
- Notifications

Teams
---------------------
A team is a digital workspace where you and your teammates can collaborate in Mattermost. Depending on how Mattermost is set up in your organization, you can belong to one team or multiple teams.

You have the ability to switch back and forth between teams on the Team Sidebar, located on the upper left side of the app.

Channels
---------------------
Channels are used to organize conversations across different topics. They are located on the left-hand panel of Mattermost. 

There are three types of channels: Public Channels, Private Channels, and Direct Messages.

**Public Channels:**

  Public Channels are open to everyone on a team. New team members are automatically added to two Public Channels when they sign up: Town Square and Off-Topic.

  Public Channels are identified with a **globe icon**.

  Click on the **More...** button at the bottom of the Public Channels section to explore more channels to join!

**Private Channels:**

  Private Channels are for sensitive topics and are only visible to selected team members. Any member of a Private Channel can add additional members. Channel members can choose to leave at any time, but only the channel owner or Team Admin can remove other members.

  Private Channels have a **lock icon**.

**Direct Messages (DM) and Group Messages (GM)**

  Direct Messages are for conversations between two people. Group Messages are Direct Messages that have conversations among three or more people. Both are visible only to the people involved.

For more information on Channels and how to manage them, `click here <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/organizing-conversations.html>`__

Messages
---------------------
Sending messages and replying to messages are important ways to keep conversations active with your team. You can edit and delete messages after you have sent them. You can also share links to any message in Mattermost.

In this example, a team manager is handing out assignments to various team members to complete as part of a review:
