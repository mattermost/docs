# Mattermost Desktop Setup Guides

## Installation

### Windows
To set up the Mattermost desktop application for Windows 7, 8 and 10:

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases) of Mattermost Desktop

   - Find the file ending in `-win64.zip` if you're running a x64 version of Windows and `-win32.zip` if you're running an older 32-bit version.

2. From the `\Downloads` directory right-click on the file and select "Extract All..."

   - Change the extract folder from `C:\Users\(currentuser)\Downloads\mattermost-desktop-1.1.1-win64` to `C:\Users\(currentuser)\AppData\Local` where `(currentuser)` will be the name of your user account.
   - Check the "Show extracted files when complete" checkbox.
   - Click the "Extract" button.
   - Look for the new application directory at `C:\Users\(currentuser)\AppData\Local\mattermost-desktop...`.
   - Remove the version number by renaming the `mattermost-desktop...` application directory to `mattermost-desktop`.
   - If a `mattermost-desktop` directory already exists then you are upgrading Mattermost, and need to quit Mattermost if it is running and then delete the `mattermost-desktop` directory. After that you can rename the `mattermost-desktop...` directory to `mattermost-desktop`. Don't worry, no settings will be lost, they are stored elsewhere.

3. Go to the `\mattermost-desktop` application directory and find the file named `Mattermost`.

   - Right-click the file and select "Pin to Taskbar" to make the application available from your Windows task bar.
   - Right-click the file and select "Pin to Start Menu" to make the application available from your Windows Start menu.
   - Double-click the file to open the application.

   The `/mattermost-desktop...` folder should be created.

3. Click on the `/mattermost-desktop...` folder, and right-click on `Mattermost` package and select "Open"
