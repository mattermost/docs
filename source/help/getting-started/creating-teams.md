# Creating Teams
___

New teams can be created if the System Admin has *Enable Team Creation* set to true from the System Console.

## Methods to Create a Team
Teams can be created from the main menu, system home page or team sign in page. The person who creates a team will automatically be given the Team Administrator role for that team. 

#### Main Menu
Click the **Three-Dot** menu in Mattermost, then select **Create a New Team**. If this option is not visible in the menu, then the System Admin has *Enable Team Creation* set to false.

#### System Home Page
Navigate to the web address of your system, `https://domain.com/`. Sign in using your credentials. Click **Create a new team** to be guided through the rest of the set up steps. If this option is not visible on the web page, then the System Admin has *Enable Team Creation* set to false. It is necessary to have an existing account on the system in order to create a team from the system home page, so if you do not have an account you will need to create one.
