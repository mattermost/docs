Team Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Team Management section allows you to add, edit and remove servers and teams.

To add a new server on the Mattermost instance, 

1. On the menu bar, go to **File** > **Settings** or press CTRL/CMD+COMMA

3. In the **Name** field, enter the name that you want for the tab. 
4. In the **URL** field, enter the complete URL of the server that you want to connect to. Must begin with either ``http://`` or ``https://``.
5. Click **Add**.
6. Click **Save**.
