Getting Started 
---------------

1. Download the `Mattermost Android app from Google Play. <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattermost.mattermost&hl=en>`__
2. Open the app and enter the web address of your server (for example: https://mattermost.company.com).
3. When you see the login page, log in as you would on your desktop.
4. Select a team to enter, join a team, or create a new team.

The above instructions are for Mattermost 3.0 and later. If you're running on Mattermost 2.x, you can `download the Android 2.x application file <https://releases.mattermost.com/client-android/mattermost-android-2.1.0.apk>`__ to install manually until your server is upgraded to 3.0.
