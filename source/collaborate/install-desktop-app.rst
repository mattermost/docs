Install and update the Mattermost desktop app
---------------------------------------------

You can `download the desktop app directly from our Downloads page <https://mattermost.com/apps/>`__. You can also use the following installation guides for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Windows

    Windows 10+ is required. Automatic app updates are supported and enabled. When a new version of the desktop app is released, your app updates automatically.

    **Install the Mattermost Desktop App**

    1. Download the latest version of the Mattermost desktop app: `32/64-bit version of Windows <https://releases.mattermost.com/desktop/5.4.0/mattermost-desktop-setup-5.4.0-win.exe>`__
    2. From the **\Downloads** folder, right-click on the file ``mattermost-desktop-setup-5.4.0-win.exe``, then select **Open** to start an installer for the app. Once finished, the Mattermost desktop app opens automatically.

    **MSI Installer and group policies (beta)**

    You can download the latest version of the Mattermost desktop app MSI installer (Beta):

    - MSI for `64-bit version of Windows <https://releases.mattermost.com/desktop/5.4.0/mattermost-desktop-5.4.0-x64.msi>`__
    - MSI for `32-bit version of Windows <https://releases.mattermost.com/desktop/5.4.0/mattermost-desktop-5.4.0-x86.msi>`__

    The following group policies are available:

    +--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------------+------------------+
    | Group policy             | Description                                                | Mattermost release   | Setting                    | State options    |

    **Disable automatic updates**      
    
    Automatic desktop app updates can be disabled by configuring the supported group policy. See the `MSI installer and group policy documentation </install/desktop-msi-installer-and-group-policy-install.html>`__ for instructions on installing the Mattermost Desktop App via an MSI installer, and configuring supported group policies. Changes to group policies require you to restart Mattermost for those changes to take effect.

  .. tab:: macOS

    MacOS 11+ is required. You have two ways to install the desktop app, and how you install the app determines whether it updates automatically.

    **Install from the App Store**

    We recommend that you install the desktop app from the `App Store <https://apps.apple.com/app/mattermost-desktop/id1614666244>`__. When you install through the App Store, your desktop app updates automatically when a new release is available.

    **Download the Desktop App from GitHub**

    You can `download the desktop app directly from our GitHub release page <https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases>`__. However, when you install the desktop app this way, you can't manually check for updates, and updates won't be installed automatically.
    
    1. Download the latest version of the Mattermost desktop app:
      
      - `Intel systems <https://releases.mattermost.com/desktop/5.4.0/mattermost-desktop-5.4.0-mac-x64.dmg>`__
      - `M1 systems <https://releases.mattermost.com/desktop/5.4.0/mattermost-desktop-5.4.0-mac-m1.dmg>`__ (Beta)

    2. Double-click the download to open the disk image.

    3. Drag the Mattermost application to the **Applications** folder.

    .. tip:: 
      You can review the current version of your desktop app by selecting **Mattermost > About Mattermost** from the macOS menu bar. 

  .. tab:: Ubuntu/Debian

    Both a beta ``.deb`` package and an official APT repository is available for Debian 9 and for Ubuntu releases 18.04 LTS or later. Automatic app updates are supported and enabled. When a new version of the desktop app is released, your app updates automatically.

    1. At the command line, set up the Mattermost repository on your system: 

       .. code-block:: none
    
        curl -o- https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/setup-repo.sh | sudo bash

    2. Extract the archive to a convenient location, then execute ``mattermost-desktop`` located inside the extracted directory.

    3. To create a Desktop launcher, open the file ``README.md``, and follow the instructions in the **Desktop launcher** section.

Log in using the desktop app
-----------------------------

The first time you log in to Mattermost using the desktop app, you'll see a splash screen that introduces you to desktop app functionality. 

1. Select **Get Started** to connect to a Mattermost server. 
2. Enter a **Server URL** and **Server display name**, then select **Connect**.

.. tip::

  Can't find your Mattermost server URL? Ask your company’s IT department or your Mattermost System Admin for your organization’s **Mattermost Site URL**. It’ll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.

Additional documentation resources
----------------------------------

The following additional documentation resources are also available for the Mattermost desktop app:

- `Desktop App changelog </install/desktop-app-changelog.html>`__
- `Configure your Desktop App experience </preferences/customize-desktop-app-experience.html>`__

Troubleshooting your Desktop App installation
----------------------------------------------

Where is configuation stored locally?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The location of the Mattermost desktop app configuration file depends on the platform where you're running Mattermost (and, in the case of macOS, how you've chosen to install the app):

- Windows: ``Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Mattermost``
- macOS installer: ``/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Mattermost``
- macOS App Store: ``/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/Mattermost/Data/Library/Application Support/Mattermost``
- Linux: ``~/.config/Mattermost``

.. note::

  - Local configuration data is not automatically removed when uninstalling the desktop app. If you wish to remove all data, you must manually remove the files from the applicable location noted above.
  - Prior to uninstalling, you can choose to log out of any active sessions. You can terminate active sessions from another Mattermost session in **Profile > Security > View and Logout of Active Sessions**, then select **Log Out**. Desktop app sessions are labeled as **Native Desktop App**.
  
How do I access logs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Mattermost desktop v5.3, you can access logs via **Help > Show logs**, which opens the file manager window showing the location of the log file.

How do I download app diagnostics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Mattermost desktop v5.3, you can download a diagnostics text file via **Help > Run diagnostics**, which can be attached to a Support ticket.

"Installation has failed" dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The app data might be corrupted. Remove all the files in ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\mattermost``, then try reinstalling the app.
    
"The application "Mattermost" can't be opened" dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On macOS Catalina, this dialog can be triggered if the Mac Archive Utility is the default method for decompressing files. In this case using a third-party tool such as `Keka <https://www.keka.io>`__ or `Unarchiver <https://macpaw.com/the-unarchiver>`__ may resolve the problem.

Desktop App window is black and doesn't load the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First, make sure you have installed the latest desktop app version.
2. Clear your cache and reload the app from **View > Clear Cache and Reload** or press :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`R` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⌘` :kbd:`⇧` :kbd:`R` on Mac.
3. Quit the app and restart it to see if the issue clears.
4. Disable GPU hardware acceleration from **File > Settings** on Windows and Linux or **Mattermost > Settings** on macOS, and unselect **Use GPU hardware acceleration**.
5. If you are using a special video driver, such as Optimus, try disabling it to see if the problem is resolved.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, please open a new ticket in the `Mattermost Troubleshooting Forum <https://forum.mattermost.com/t/how-to-use-the-troubleshooting-forum/150>`__.

Desktop App is not visible, but the Mattermost icon is in the Task Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur on Windows in a multiple-monitor setup. When you disconnect the monitor that Mattermost is displayed on, Mattermost continues to display at screen coordinates that no longer exist.

To resolve this issue, you can reset the desktop app screen location by deleting the screen location file. When the file is not present, the desktop app displays on the primary monitor by default.

To reset the desktop app screen location:

1. If the desktop app is running, right-click the Mattermost icon in the task bar, then select **Close Window**.
2. Open Windows File Explorer, and go to the ``%APPDATA%\\Mattermost`` folder.
3. Delete the file ``bounds-info.json``.

Desktop App constantly refreshes the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur when ``localStorage`` has an unexpected state. To resolve the issue:

- Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, go to the ``%APPDATA%\Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
- Mac: Open Finder, go to the ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
- Linux: Open the File Manager, go to the ``~/.config/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder. Linux file managers may hide folders starting with a period by default. You can delete them from the terminal using ``rm -rf ~/.config/Mattermost``.
      
Desktop App constantly asks to log in to Mattermost server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur after a crash or unexpected shutdown of the desktop app that causes the app data to be corrupted. To resolve the issue:

- Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, go to the ``%APPDATA%\\Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.
- Mac: Open Finder, go to the ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.
- Linux: Open the file manager, go to the ``~/.config/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files. Linux file managers may hide folders starting with a period by default. You can delete them from the terminal using ``rm -rf ~/.config/Mattermost``.

"Internal error: BrowserWindow 'unresponsive' event has been emitted"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selecting **Show Details** on the dialog provides logs. Ways to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the cache via **View > Clear Cache and Reload** or press :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`R` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⌘` :kbd:`⇧` :kbd:`R` on Mac.
2. Go to App Settings via **File > Settings** (or by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`,` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⌘` :kbd:`,` on Mac) and unselect hardware acceleration.
