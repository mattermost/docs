If you read a message, but don't have time to address it right away, you can mark that message as unread. Marking a message as unread displays the channel as bold in the channel sidebar, and groups the message with all other unread messages. 

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Hover over the message, select the **More** |more-actions-icon| option, then select **Mark as Unread**.
