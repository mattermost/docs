Archive a channel
-----------------

Delete :ref:`public channels <collaborate/channel-types:public channels>` and :ref:`private channels <collaborate/channel-types:private channels>` when they're no longer needed by archiving them. Archiving channels removes them from the channel sidebar and marks them as read-only. Anyone can archive a public or private channel they're a member of, unless your system admin has :doc:`disabled </onboard/advanced-permissions>` your ability to do so.

.. tip::

  You can continue to access archived channels, unless your system admin has :ref:`disabled <configure/site-configuration-settings:allow users to view archived channels>` your ability to do so.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  To archive a channel, select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Archive Channel**. 

.. tab:: Mobile

  To archive a channel:
  
  1. Tap the channel you want to delete.

.. note::

  - When a Mattermost user is deactivated in the system, your :ref:`direct message channel <collaborate/channel-types:direct message channels>` with that user are archived and marked as read-only. An **Archived** icon |file-box| displays next to archived channels.
  - :ref:`Group message channels <collaborate/channel-types:group message channels>` can't be archived, but they can be closed to hide them from the channel sidebar.
  - The default **Town Square** channel can't be archived.
  - System admins can archive channels without needing to be a channel member by using the System Console.
  - Because a copy of the channel exists on the server, you can't reuse the URL of an archived channel when :doc:`creating a new channel </collaborate/create-channels>`.

Unarchive a channel
-------------------

System admins and Team admins can restore archived channels. When a channel is unarchived, channel membership and all its content is restored, unless messages and files have been deleted based on a :ref:`data retention policy <configure/compliance-configuration-settings:data retention policies>`.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Search for the channel if required. Then, open the channel, select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu and select **Unarchive Channel**.
