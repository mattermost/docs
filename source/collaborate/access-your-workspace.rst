Access your workspace
=====================

Access your Mattermost instance with your credentials using a web browser, the desktop app, or the mobile app for iOS or Android. Depending on how Mattermost is configured, you'll log in using your email address, username, or single sign-on (SSO) username, and your password.

.. tip::

  Can't find your Mattermost link? Ask your company's IT department or your Mattermost system admin for your organization's **Mattermost Site URL**. It'll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.

Multi-factor authentication
---------------------------

If your system admin :ref:`enables multi-factor authentication <onboard/multi-factor-authentication:enabling mfa>` for your Mattermost instance, you can :doc:`optionally set up multi-factor authentication </preferences/manage-your-security-preferences>` for your Mattermost user account by selecting your profile picture located in the top-right corner of Mattermost, and going to **Security > Multi-Factor Authentication**.

If your system admin :ref:`enforces multi-factor authentication <onboard/multi-factor-authentication:enforcing mfa>`, you are required to :doc:`set up multi-factor authentication </preferences/manage-your-security-preferences>` for your Mattermost account. When you attempt to log in to Mattermost, you're directed to the multi-factor authentication setup page. You won't be able to access Mattermost until multi-factor setup is complete. If you encounter issues setting up multi-factor authentication, contact your Mattermost system admin for assistance.
