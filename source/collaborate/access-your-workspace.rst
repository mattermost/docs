=====================

Mattermost is accessible through a URL link. You'll receive a link from your Mattermost system admin or through an email invitation. You can use that link in a web browser, or as a server connection in the `desktop app </collaborate/install-desktop-app.html>`__, the `mobile app for iOS </collaborate/install-ios-app.html>`__, or the `mobile app for Android </collaborate/install-android-app.html>`__.

.. tip::

  - Is your Mattermost hosted externally? You can access Cloud workspaces from the `Cloud Workspace Connection <https://customers.mattermost.com/cloud/connect-workspace>`__ page by specifying your company or domain name.
  - Can't find your Mattermost link? Ask your company's IT department or your Mattermost system admin for your organization's **Mattermost Site URL**. It'll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.
