Access your workspace
=====================

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

Your Mattermost :doc:`workspace </guides/use-mattermost>` is accessible through a URL link. You'll receive a link from your Mattermost system admin or through an email invitation. You can use that link in a web browser, or as a server connection in the :doc:`desktop app </collaborate/install-desktop-app>`, the :doc:`mobile app for iOS </collaborate/install-ios-app>`, or the :doc:`mobile app for Android </collaborate/install-android-app>`.

.. tip::

  Can't find your Mattermost link? Ask your company's IT department or your Mattermost system admin for your organization's **Mattermost Site URL**. It'll look something like ``https://example.com/company/mattermost``, ``mattermost.yourcompanydomain.com``, or ``chat.yourcompanydomain.com``. These URLs could also end in ``.net``.

    - We recommend bookmarking the Mattermost URL in your browser of choice so logging into Mattermost is easy in the future.
    - The credentials you use to log in depend on how your system admin has configured Mattermost. You may be prompted for an `email address or username <#email-address-or-username>`__ and a password, or you may be able to `log in using other credentials <#single-sign-on-sso>`__. Contact your system admin for more information.

Multi-factor authentication
---------------------------

If your system admin :ref:`enables multi-factor authentication <onboard/multi-factor-authentication:enabling mfa>` for your Mattermost instance, you can :doc:`optionally set up multi-factor authentication </preferences/manage-your-security-preferences>` for your Mattermost user account by selecting your profile picture located in the top-right corner of Mattermost, and going to **Security > Multi-Factor Authentication**.

If your system admin :ref:`enforces multi-factor authentication <onboard/multi-factor-authentication:enforcing mfa>`, you are required to :doc:`set up multi-factor authentication </preferences/manage-your-security-preferences>` for your Mattermost account. When you attempt to log in to Mattermost, you're directed to the multi-factor authentication setup page. You won't be able to access Mattermost until multi-factor setup is complete. If you encounter issues setting up multi-factor authentication, contact your Mattermost system admin for assistance.
