You must be a system admin, team admin, or channel admin to convert public channels to private channels. When a channel is converted from public to private, its history and membership are preserved. Membership in a private channel remains as invitation only. Publicly-shared files remain accessible to anyone with the link.

.. note::
    Default channels such as ``Town Square`` and ``Off-Topic`` can't be converted to private channels.

Convert private channels to public channels
-------------------------------------------

Due to potential security concerns with sharing private channel history, only system admins can convert private channels to public channels via **System Console > Channels > Edit (Channel Configuration)**. 

Alternatively, System Admins can perform this action using the `mmctl channel modify command </manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html#mmctl-channel-modify>`__.
