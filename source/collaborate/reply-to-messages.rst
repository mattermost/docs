    Tap on a message to reply to it, or long press and select **Reply**.

Depending on how the system admin has configured Mattermost, you may also be able to `edit and delete messages </collaborate/send-messages.html#edit-or-delete-messages>`__ after you've sent them. Your system admin may also restrict messaging actions, such as editing or deleting messages, by configuring `advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions.html>`__, available in `Mattermost Enterprise and Professional subscription plans <https://mattermost.com/pricing>`__.

.. tip::

  It's easy to return to a message in progress with global message drafts. Find all of your draft messages in the **Drafts** view available at the top of the channel sidebar. See the `draft messages </collaborate/send-messages.html#draft-messages>`__ documentation for details.

Organize conversations into threads
-----------------------------------

When you reply to messages, those replies are organized into a conversation thread. Threaded conversations are easy to follow and allow multiple parallel conversations to occur at the same time without confusion. 

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, replies appear indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message, and selecting the reply link opens a sidebar in the right-hand sidebar in a web browser and the desktop app. To expand the right-hand sidebar to its full width, select the **Expand** icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar.

To shrink the right-hand sidebar to its original width, select the same **Collapse** icon.
