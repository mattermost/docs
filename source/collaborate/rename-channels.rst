Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the System Admin has :doc:`restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions>`.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Rename Channel**. You'll be prompted to provide two pieces of information:

  - **Channel display name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface. 
  - **Channel handle:** This is part of the channel URL. You can also change the channel handle when renaming a channel, but changing channel handles may break existing links.

  For example, for the following channel, ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``, The channel display name would be ``UX Design``, and the channel handle would be ``ux-design``.

.. tab:: Mobile

  1. Tap the channel you want to rename.
  2. Tap the **More** |more-icon| icon located in the top right corner of the app.
  3. Tap **View info**.
  4. Tap **Edit Channel**.
  5. You're prompted to provide three pieces of information:

    - **Name:** This appears in the Mattermost user interface.
    - **Purpose:** (Optional) Used to describe the channel's function or goal.
    - **Header:** (Optional) Used to include information relevant to the channel, such as key contacts or document links.
