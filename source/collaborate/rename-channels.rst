Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the system admin has :doc:`restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions>`.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Channel Settings**. You'll be prompted to provide two pieces of information:

  - **Channel name:** The channel name that displays in the Mattermost user interface for all users. Enter a different channel name if needed or preferred.
  - **Channel URL:** The web URL used to access the channel in a web browser. Select **Edit** to change the URL, and select **Done** to save your changes.

  For example, a channel could be named ``UX Design`` and have a URL of ``https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design``.
