The `Mattermost for Microsoft Teams plugin </about/mattermost-for-microsoft-teams.html>`__ integration enables you to collaborate with Microsoft Teams users without leaving Mattermost. Getting started with this integration includes 2 steps:

- `Connecting your Mattermost account <#connect-your-mattermost-account-to-your-microsoft-teams-account>`_
- `Selecting your preferred platform <#select-your-preferred-platform>`_

Connect your Mattermost account to your Microsoft Teams account
---------------------------------------------------------------

To use the Microsoft Teams plugin, you must connect your Mattermost user account to your Microsoft Teams account. You only need to complete this step once.

1. Log into Mattermost using your credentials. 
2. When you log in, you’ll be prompted to enter your Microsoft Teams user information, including your Microsoft Teams email address and your Microsoft Teams password.

.. note::

  - To change which accounts are linked, in Mattermost, disconnect the current account by running the slash command ``/msteams disconnect`` within the Mattermost message text box. Then, re-connect a new Mattermost account to a new Microsoft Teams account by running the Mattermost slash command ``/msteams connect``.
  - If your Microsoft Teams user account is removed from Microsoft Teams, your linked Mattermost user account will also be removed the next time user accounts are synchronized across the two platforms.

Mattermost will confirm when your account is connected, and prompt you to select your primary platform.

Select your preferred platform
-------------------------------

Once you've connected your Mattermost account to your Microsoft Teams account, Mattermost prompts you to choose which platform you'll use more often: `Mattermost <#mattermost-is-your-preferred-platform>`_ or `Microsoft Teams <#microsoft-teams-is-your-preferred-platform>`_. Mattermost optimizes your experience based on the platform you prefer to use.

.. note::

  - If you're not prompted to connect your accounts, run the Mattermost slash command ``/msteams connect`` within the Mattermost message text box to display the prompt in a browser window. Follow the link to connect your accounts.
  - If you select **Skip for now**, Mattermost is selected as your primary platform. You can change this preference any time by selecting your profile picture and going to **Settings > MS Teams Settings**.

Mattermost is your preferred platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Mattermost is preferred, you'll receive Microsoft Teams messages and notifications in Mattermost.

We recommend that you disable notifications in Microsoft Teams. If you don't, you'll receive duplicate message notifications in both platforms. See the `Microsoft Teams notifications documentation <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-notifications-in-microsoft-teams-1cc31834-5fe5-412b-8edb-43fecc78413d>`__ for details.

Microsoft Teams is your preferred platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Microsoft Teams is preferred, you'll receive mesages from Mattermost in Microsoft Teams. Mattermost notifications are automatically muted for you to prevent duplicate notifications.

Setup complete
--------------

Setup is complete! You're ready to collaborate across your organization, regardless of which platform you’re in. You have two ways to collaborate:

- `Through direct and group messages <#collaborate-through-messages>`_
- `Through linked channels <#collaborate-through-linked-channels>`_

Collaborate through messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start a direct or group message between Mattermost and Microsoft Teams users unless your Mattermost administrator has `disabled the ability to do so in the System Console </configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#sync-direct-and-group-messages>`__. 

- Within Mattermost select the |plus-icon| icon next to **Direct Messages** in the left pane, then search for the user you want to message. Your direct or group conversation is visible in both Mattermost and Microsoft Teams.

- Within Microsoft Teams, select **Chat > New chat**, and select the users you want to chat with. Your conversation is visible in both Mattermost and Microsoft Teams for all users who have connected their Mattermost user account to their Microsoft Teams user account.

Collaborate through linked channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collaborating through linked channels starts with a Mattermost admin linking a Mattermost public or private channel to a Microsot Teams channel. 

Link channels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a Mattermost channel admin, team admin, or system admin, run the following slash command in the channel you want to link: ``/msteams link``, then select the Microsoft Teams team and channel identifiers you want to link the current Mattermost channel to. Mattermost notifies you when the linking is complete or if the channel is already linked.

.. tip:: 

  Want to change an existing link? Unlink a current Mattermost channel using the ``/msteams unlink`` slash command, then relink to a new Microsoft Teams channel as needed.

Collaborate with colleagues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have many ways to collaborate with colleagues in linked channels using a web browser or the Mattermost desktop app, including:

- `Send messages </collaborate/send-messages.html>`__ and `reply to messages <h/collaborate/reply-to-messages.html>`__
- `Attach files to messages </collaborate/share-files-in-messages.html>`__
- `Express yourself with emojis and GIFs </collaborate/react-with-emojis-gifs.html>`__
- `Share complex systems data and formatted code </collaborate/format-messages.html>`__
- `Edit or delete sent messages </collaborate/send-messages.html#edit-or-delete-messages>`__

No matter which platform you use, your message is visible across both Mattermost and Microsoft Teams.
