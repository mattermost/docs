Send messages
=============

.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

You can send messages in public and private channels as well as to other users in Mattermost.

.. tip::

  - When you send messages in a channel, depending on the :doc:`channel actions configured </collaborate/create-channels>`, specific words in the post can trigger a prompt to run a playbook. Access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured for the current channel.
  - If you're sending a direct message to another user, Mattermost warns you when the recipient's availability is set to :ref:`Do Not Disturb <preferences/set-your-status-availability:set your availability>`, and when the recipient's local time is outside of regular business hours (between 10PM and 6AM). This warning displays directly above the message text field.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Enter a message in the text field, then select **Send** |send-icon| to send the message. 

  .. tip::
    
    You can also use a keyboard to send messages:
  
    - Press :kbd:`Enter` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`↵` on Mac. 
    - You can configure Mattermost to require :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`Enter` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⇧` :kbd:`↵` on Mac to send multi-line messages. Select the **gear** |gear| icon to go to **Settings**, then select **Advanced > Send messages on CTRL+ENTER**.

.. tab:: Mobile

  1. Tap the text field at the bottom of the Mattermost app to type a message.

Draft messages
--------------

From Mattermost v7.7, when composing new messages, it's easy to return to a message in progress later, unless your system admin has :ref:`disabled global drafts <configure/site-configuration-settings:enable server syncing of message drafts>` in the System Console.

By default, message drafts are synchronized on the Mattermost server and are accessible everywhere you access Mattermost, including a web browser or the desktop app. Limit drafts to your current Mattermost client only by going to **Settings > Advanced > Allow message drafts to sync with the server** to disable draft synchronization.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  Draft messages are added to a **Drafts** view available at the top of the channel sidebar.

.. tab:: Mobile

  When composing a message, you can simply opt to complete it later. The partially composed message is kept in the text field and an **Edit** option |edit-icon| displays next to the channel name.

Edit messages
--------------

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  All users can edit their own sent messages, unless the system admin has :doc:`restricted the ability to do so </onboard/advanced-permissions>`.

  1. Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, select the **More** |more-icon| icon next to a message that you've sent.

    .. image:: ../images/more-actions.png
      :alt: Select the More option to edit or delete a sent message.

  2. Select **Edit** to edit your own messages. Editing a message won't trigger new :doc:`@mention notifications </collaborate/mention-people>`, or :doc:`desktop notifications </preferences/manage-your-notifications>`.

.. tab:: Mobile

  1. Long press on the message that you want to edit and tap on **Edit**.

Restore a previous version of an edited message
-----------------------------------------------

From Mattermost v7.9, `Mattermost Enterprise or Professional <https://mattermost.com/pricing>`__ customers can `edit or delete messages <#edit-or-delete-messages>`__ after sending them if your system admin hasn't restricted the ability to do so using :doc:`advanced permissions </onboard/advanced-permissions>`.

Message recipients can't see your message edit history, and restoring a previous message version won't trigger new :doc:`@mention notifications </collaborate/mention-people>`.

.. note::
  
  Restoring a previous version of the message is available in the Mattermost desktop app or a web browser. The ability to restore using the mobile app isn't supported.

1. Select the word **Edited** next to your message. 
2. In the right pane, review all previous versions of the message.
3. Select the **Restore** |restore-edit| icon next to the version you want to restore.
4. Select **Confirm**.

Do more with your messages
--------------------------

.. tip::

  Using a RTL plugin, Mattermost can automatically detect and display messages written using right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian. Your system admin must install the `RTL Plugin <https://github.com/QueraTeam/mattermost-rtl>`_ to enable this functionality.

Express yourself in Mattermost messages using the following features:

- :doc:`Schedule messages </collaborate/schedule-messages>`
- :doc:`Set message priority </collaborate/message-priority>`
- :doc:`Format messages </collaborate/format-messages>`
- :doc:`Mention people </collaborate/mention-people>`
- :doc:`Share files </collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`
- :doc:`Share links to channels and messages </collaborate/share-links>`
