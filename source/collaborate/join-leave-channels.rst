Join a channel
--------------

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a **Globe** |globe| icon. Anyone on the team can join a public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are identified with a **Lock** |lock| icon. You must be invited to private channels by another channel member.

.. note::
  
  To join a private channel, you need to be added to the channel by a member of that channel.

To join a public channel:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Web/Desktop

    1. Select the **Add channels** button in the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**.

  When you join channels, depending on the `channel actions configured </collaborate/create-channels.html>`__, you may see a welcome message, and channels may be added to `a category in your channel sidebar </collaborate/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__ automatically. 
  Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been configured.

See the following documentation to learn more about working with channels:
