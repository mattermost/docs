Go hands-free with Copilot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable your Operating System's voice dictation or speech recognition tools for hands-free communication with Copilot.

.. tab:: Windows

  1. Start a direct message chat with Copilot, and ensure your cursor is in the Mattermost message text box.
  2. Ensure your microphone is connected and working.
  3. Activate Microsoft Voice Typing by pressing the **Windows** key + :kbd:`H` to open the voice typing tool.
  4. Start talking. Windows transforms your voice into text within Mattermost.

  See Microsoft's `Voice Typing documentation <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f>`_ to learn more about working with Microsoft's Voice Typing tools.

.. tab:: MacOS

  1. Navigate to **System Settings > Keyboard > Dictation** and enable dictation.

    a. Ensure the Microphone source is set correctly.
    b. Specify the shortcut key you want to use to turn dictation on and off.

  2. Start a direct message chat with Copilot, and ensure your cursor is in the Mattermost message text box.
  3. Turn dictation on with the shortcut key you configured, and then start talking. MacOS transforms your voice into text within Mattermost.

  See Apple's `Voice control documentation <https://support.apple.com/en-us/102225>`_ to learn more about working with Apple's dictation tools.

.. tab:: Linux

  You'll need an open-source speech recognition tool for Linux, such as `Simon <https://simon.kde.org/>`_, `SpeechControl <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SpeechControl>`_, or `Julius <https://github.com/julius-speech/julius>`_

  Once you have a speech recognition tool installed and working, enable it, start a direct message with Copilot, and start talking.

.. tip::

  When working with AI technology like Copilot, it's important to understand that the process is often iterative. Using an iterative approach ensures that you leverage Copilot to complement your work, leading to higher quality results. Here are some tips for being more effective with Copilot:

  - Avoid a one-and-done mindset: Don't assume that the first output from Copilot will be perfect. Instead, review and refine the content to ensure it meets your standards and needs.

    - Make corrections. Use voice dictation to say, "In the second section, remove mention of widgets. Add voice memos instead."
    - Make edits. For example, say "Remove Section 3" or "Switch Section 3 with Section 5"
    - Reduce unnecessary words. Say, "Remove unnecessary phrases to make this more concise."
    - Compact statements. Say, "Condense this into a single paragraph."

  - Use AI as a tool, not a replacement: Treat the outputs generated by Copilot as initial drafts. Copilot can help you enhance your writing and analysis, not replace your own skills and judgment. Think of Copilot as your very own high-tech assistant that can provide suggestions and help you brainstorm.
  - Iterate for quality: Go through multiple rounds of revisions to catch errors, improve clarity, and refine the content to better align with your goals. By continually reviewing and tweaking the outputs, you'll end up with more polished and accurate content, and maximize the value of Copilot by producing professional-grade results.
