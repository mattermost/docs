You can view technical details about your Mattermost server, including version information and system metrics. This information is useful when working with Mattermost support or troubleshooting issues.

About dialog information
------------------------

The About dialog displays key information about your Mattermost instance, including:

- **Mattermost Version**: The current version of the Mattermost server
- **Database Schema Version**: The version of the database schema in use
- **License**: Information about your Mattermost license (if applicable)
- **Build Information**: Details about the server build

Load Metric field
-----------------

From Mattermost server v10.10, the About dialog includes a **Load Metric** field that displays server activity levels. This metric reflects current server usage and provides a contextual data point used by Mattermost support and technical teams when assisting with deployments.

The Load Metric field is particularly useful in cases where Mattermost support packets or site statistics cannot be shared externally, as it provides support teams with a reference point for understanding server usage patterns and troubleshooting issues.

.. note::

   The Load Metric is not a standalone indicator of system performance or health, but rather provides contextual information about server activity levels to assist with support and troubleshooting efforts.
