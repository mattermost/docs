Add members to a channel
------------------------

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, any member of a channel can add other members to public or private channels, unless your System Admin has restricted access to do so.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Web/Desktop

    1. Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Add Members**.

        :alt: Use options available through the channel name to add a member to a channel.

    2. Search for users, select users, then select **Add** to add users to the current channel. Mattermost notifies you when a user is already a member of the channel.

    .. tip::

      - From Mattermost v7.8, people you've messaged directly are listed first, followed by all users in alphabetical order. 
      - Alternatively, to add members to a channel, select the channel name, select the **View Info** |channel-info| icon, select **Members** in the right pane, and then select **Add**.

  .. tab:: Mobile

    1. Tap the channel name at the top of the screen.
    2. Tap **Add members**. 
    3. Select members to add to the channel. You can scroll through the alphabetical list of members, or search for members in the Search field.
    4. Tap **Add Members**.

.. note::

   You can also @mention users to add them to a channel. If they're not a channel member, Mattermost prompts you to add them.

Using a web browser or the desktop app, you can also add users to channels within their profile pop-over.
