     2. Enter a channel name.
     3. Choose whether this is a public or private channel. See the `channel types </collaborate/channel-types.html>`__ documentation to learn more about public and private channels.
     4. (Optional) Describe the channel's focus or purpose. This text is visible to all channel members in the channel header.

    **To start a direct or group message**
        
     1. Select the **+** symbol next to the **Direct Messages** category in the channel sidebar.

     2. Select up to seven users by searching or browsing.

    .. tip::
     
     - Alternatively, select the **+** symbol at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Open a Direct Message**. In the **Direct Messages** list, you'll see your most recent conversations.
     - To add more people to the conversation select the channel name, then select **Add Members**. Adding members to a group message creates a new channel and starts a new conversation.
     - You can't remove members of a group message; however, you can start a new group channel and conversation with different members.
     - If you want to add more than 7 users to a group message, create a private channel instead.

      
  .. tab:: Mobile
   
    **To create a public or private channel**
        
    Tap the **+** symbol in the top right corner of the app, then select **Create New Channel**. Channels are created as public by default. If you want to create a private channel, tap the **Make Private** option.

    **To start a direct or group message**
    
    Tap the **+** symbol in the top right corner of the app, then select **Open a Direct Message**. You can select one person for a direct message or up to seven people for a group message. Tap **Start** to start the conversation.

.. tip::

  **Automate with channel actions**
  
  The person who creates a channel automatically becomes the channel admin. Channel admins using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app can access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down menu in the center pane to set up automatic actions when users `join the channel </collaborate/join-leave-channels.html#join-a-channel>`__ or `post a message </collaborate/send-messages.html>`__ to the channel.
  
  Automatic actions include:
  
  - Displaying a temporary welcome message for new channel members.
  - Automatically adding the channel to a `category in the user's channel sidebar </preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar.html>`__.
  - Prompting to run a playbook based on the contents of a message.

  The `playbooks must be enabled </configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#mattermost-playbooks>`__ for channel admins to use channel actions.
