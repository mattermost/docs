Channels are where you connect, collaborate, and communicate with your team about various topics or projects. Use channels to organize conversations across different topics. as you're :doc:`sending messages </collaborate/send-messages>`, :doc:`replying to messages </collaborate/reply-to-messages>`, and :ref:`participating in conversation threads <collaborate/organize-conversations:start or reply to threads>`.

You're added to default channels automatically
----------------------------------------------

Everyone who joins a Mattermost :doc:`workspace </guides/use-mattermost>` is automatically added to the **Town Square** channel. See our :doc:`Channel Types </collaborate/channel-types>` documentation for details.

.. note::
  The Town Square channel can't be :ref:`archived <collaborate/archive-unarchive-channels:archive a channel>` or :doc:`converted to a private channel </collaborate/convert-public-channels>`, and users can't :ref:`leave <collaborate/join-leave-channels:leave a channel>` this default channel. However, guests who are manually invited to **Town Square** can leave the channel.

Channel sidebar
----------------

In the channel sidebar on the left, you'll find all of the the channels you're a member of as well as useful channel management tools. See the :doc:`channel types </collaborate/channel-types>` to learn about the types of channels available, how they work, and how to identify them in the channel sidebar. Learn how to create channels by visiting the :doc:`create channels </collaborate/create-channels>` documentation.

As your channel sidebar fills up with channels you've joined, you can organize your channels into categories based on how you work. See the :doc:`customize your channel sidebar </preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar>` documentation for details.
