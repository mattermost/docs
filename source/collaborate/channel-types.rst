Channels are used to organize conversations across different topics. The channels you're a member of display in the left pane. Learn how to create channels by visiting the :doc:`create channels </collaborate/create-channels>` documentation.

There are 5 types of channels in Mattermost: 

- `Public channels <#public-channels>`__
- `Private channels <#private-channels>`__
- `Direct message channels <#direct-message-channels>`__
- `Group message channels <#group-message-channels>`__
- `Archived channels <#archived-channels>`__

.. tip::
  
  Enterprise customers can additionally configure :ref:`read-only <onboard/advanced-permissions:read only channels>` broadcast channels.

Public channels
---------------

Public channels are open to everyone on a team and are identified with a **Globe** |globe| icon. New team members are automatically added to two public channels when they sign up: **Town Square** and **Off-Topic**.

See the :doc:`Join and leave channels </collaborate/join-leave-channels>` documentation for details on discovering, joining, and leaving other channels.

Private channels
----------------

Private channels are channels for sensitive topics and are only visible to selected team members. Private channels are identified with a **Lock** |lock| icon. Channel members can choose to leave private channels at any time.

.. note::

  - Mattermost Enterprise and Professional customers can restrict channel management to system and channel admins.
  - In a Mattermost Team Edition instance, any member of a private channel can add or remove other members from private channels.

Direct message channels
-----------------------

Direct message channels are for conversations between 2 people. Only members of the conversation can see direct messages and channel heading information, including the last active status of the other user.

You can start a direct message with people on other teams :ref:`unless the system admin has disabled your ability to do so <configure/site-configuration-settings:enable users to open direct message channels with>`.  

Direct messages update the numbered badge count and trigger a notification unless the direct message is muted, or your notifications are disabled. See the :doc:`notification documentation </preferences/manage-your-notifications>` for details on customizing notifications based on your preferences.

.. note::

  - From Mattermost v10, when sending a direct message, Mattermost warns you that the recipient's availability is set to :ref:`Do Not Disturb <preferences/set-your-status-availability:set your availability>`, and when the recipient's local time is outside of regular business hours (between 10PM and 6AM). This warning displays directly above the message text field.
  - When a Mattermost user is deactivated in the system, your :ref:`direct message channel <collaborate/channel-types:direct message channels>` with that user are `archived <#archived-channels>`__ and marked as read-only. An **Archived** icon |file-box| displays next to archived channels.

Group message channels
----------------------

Group message channels are for conversations between 3 to 7 people. Only members of the conversation can see group messages. Group messages always display a new message badge.

Want to have a group conversation with more than 7 people? :doc:`Create a private channel </collaborate/create-channels>`. Alternatively, from Mattermost v9.1, you can :doc:`convert group messages to a private channel </collaborate/convert-group-messages>`.

.. note::

  - You can start a group message with people on other teams when :ref:`unless the system admin has disabled your ability to do so <configure/site-configuration-settings:enable users to open direct message channels with>`.
  - From Mattermost v9.1, group messages increase the numbered badge count and trigger a notification unless the direct message is muted, or your notifications are disabled. Control how you're notified about group message conversations by going to **Settings > Notifications**. See the :doc:`notification documentation </preferences/manage-your-notifications>` to learn more.
  - Any group message history you have with a deactivated user remains available :ref:`unless your system admin disables your ability to do so <configure/site-configuration-settings:allow users to view archived channels>`.

Archived channels
-----------------

Archived channels are deactivated public, private, direct message, or group message channels that are no longer used. Archived channels are identified with a **File Box** |file-box| icon. 

:ref:`Archiving a channel <collaborate/archive-unarchive-channels:archive a channel>` marks it read-only to prevent new messages from being sent and preserve channel history. You can continue to access archived channels, unless your system admin has :ref:`disabled <configure/site-configuration-settings:allow users to view archived channels>` your ability to do so.
