You can change the members of your group conversation by converting the group message to a private channel. When a group message is converted to private, its history and membership are preserved. Membership in a private channel remains as invitation only.

.. note::

    - Any member of an existing group message, except `guests </onboard/guest-accounts.html>`__, can convert that group message to a private channel.
    - All group message participants must share at least one team membership.
    - You can convert a group message to a private channel using a web browser or the desktop app.

To convert a group message to a private channel:

1. Select the group message name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Convert to Private Channel**.
2. Specify the team where the new private channel will be created. You're prompted to specify a team when all group message members share more than one team membership.
3. Enter a channel name.
4. Select **Convert to private channel**.
