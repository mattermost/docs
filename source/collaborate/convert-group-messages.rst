You can change the members of your group conversation by converting the group message to a private channel. When a group message is converted to private, its history and membership are preserved. Membership in a private channel remains as invitation only.

.. note::

    - Any member of an existing group message can convert that group message to a private channel, but all group message particpants must be members of the same team.
    - You can convert a group message to a private channel using a web browser or the desktop app.

To convert a group message to a private channel:

1. Select the group message name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Convert to Private Channel**.
2. Enter a channel name.
3. Select **Convert to private channel**.
