From Mattermost v9.1, you can change the members of your group conversation by converting the group message to a private channel. When a group message is converted to private, its history and membership are preserved. Membership in a private channel remains as invitation only.

.. note::

    - Any member of an existing group message, except :doc:`guests </onboard/guest-accounts>`, can convert that group message to a private channel.
    - Conversation history will be visible to all channel members.
    - All group message participants must share at least one team membership.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  1. Select the group message name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Convert to Private Channel**.
  2. Specify the team where the new private channel will be created. You're prompted to specify a team when all group message members share more than one team membership.
  3. Enter a channel name.
  4. Select **Convert to private channel**.
