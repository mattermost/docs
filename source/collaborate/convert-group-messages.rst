From Mattermost v9.1, you can change the members of your group conversation by converting the group message to a private channel. When a group message is converted to private, its history and membership are preserved. Membership in a private channel remains as invitation only.

.. note::

    - Any member of an existing group message, except `guests </onboard/guest-accounts.html>`__, can convert that group message to a private channel.
    - Conversation history will be visible to all channel members.
    - All group message participants must share at least one team membership.

  3. Enter a channel name.
