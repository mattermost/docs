If you require your data to reside in an area outside of the United States, please contact the product team via feedback-cloud[at]mattermost.com, or consider `deploying one of our Self-Hosted options <https://mattermost.com/deploy>`_ that provides full control of your data. You may also work with `one of our European partners <https://mattermost.com/partners>`_ for deploying and hosting your Mattermost server.
