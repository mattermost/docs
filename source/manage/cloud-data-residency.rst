Mattermost Cloud resides in the ``aws-us-east-1`` region, located in Virginia, United States. The following customer data will be stored at rest in this data center when using Mattermost Cloud:

- Channels, messages, replies, and channel membership information
- Playbooks and event runs
- User accounts and profiles 
- Files (e.g., images, docs, etc.) uploaded to the Mattermost Service
- Plugin, app- or bot-generated messages and files
- Data used to measure user count, usage, and revenue
- Data used for analytics and to measure quality of service, e.g., sanitized logs
- IDs generated by Mattermost on behalf of the customer

If you require your data to reside in an area outside of the United States, please contact the product team via `feedback-cloud@mattermost.com <feedback-cloud@mattermost.com>`_, or consider `deploying one of our self-hosted options <https://mattermost.com/deploy>`_ that provides full control of your data. You may also work with `one of our European partners <https://mattermost.com/partners>`_ for deploying and hosting your Mattermost server.
