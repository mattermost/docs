Statistics on users, posts, and channels are tracked for each system and team. Enterprise Editions have access to advanced system statistics.

.. note::

  To maximize performance for large Enterprise deployments, statistics for total posts, total hashtag posts, total file posts, posts per day, and active users with posts per day are disabled. You can re-enable them by changing the ``MaxUsersForStatistics`` value `in config.json </configure/configuration-settings.html#maximum-users-for-statistics>`__.

For advanced metrics for Enterprise deployments, `see performance monitoring documentation to learn more </scale/performance-monitoring.html>`__.

Troubleshooting/FAQ
-------------------

I see an error: "Not enough data for a meaningful representation"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the statistics page is loading endlessly and you get an error message saying "Not enough data for a meaningful representation", check whether you're using an ad blocker. An ad blocker can prevent this page from loading data. To test this, temporarily disable your ad blocker, or view the page in a browser without an ad blocker installed.

Can Team Admins review their own team's statistics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. In Mattermost Enterprise, you can enable Team Admins to see their team's statistics by modifying available System Admin roles. Learn more about System Admin roles, including how to manage privileges and assign roles, in the `Additional System Admin Roles </onboard/system-admin-roles.html>`__ documentation.

To enable Team Admins to access their team's statistics:

1. Go to **System Console > User Management > System Roles**, then edit the **Viewer** System Admin role. 

.. image:: ../images/edit-viewer-system-admin-role.png
   :alt: Enable Team Admins to access their team's statistics in the System Console by going to User Management > System Roles, and making changes to the Viewer role.

2. Under **Privileges**, expand the **Reporting** section, set **Team Statistics** to **Read only**, then set **Site Statistics** and **Server Logs** to **No access**.

3. Set all other privileges to **No access** to restrict all users with the **Viewer** role to access only the **Team Statistics** page in the System Console.   

.. image:: ../images/restrict-role-access.png
   :alt: On the Viewer page, restrict user access to the Team Statistics page by expanding the Reporting section, setting Site Statistics and Server Logs to No Access, and setting all other privileges to No Access. 

4. Under **Assigned People**, select **Add People** to assign Team Admins to the **Viewer** role, and enable them to access their team's statistics.

.. image:: ../images/assign-people-to-system-role.png
   :alt: On the Viewer page, specify which users can access the Team Statistics page by assigning specific users the Viewer admin role. 

5. Select **Save**.

.. note::

    System Admins must manually add people to or remove people from the **Viewer** System Admin role to address Team Admin changes, such as promotions or demotions.
