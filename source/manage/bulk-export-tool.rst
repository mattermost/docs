Moving data from one Mattermost instance into another begins with exporting data to a `JSONL <https://jsonlines.org>`__ file using the
`bulk loading feature <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/bulk-loading-data.html>`__. This tool is useful if you have created a server for a proof of concept, have created another server for production use, and now want to retain the history from the proof of concept instance.

You can export the following data types:

- Teams
- Channels (Public and Private)
- Users
- Users' Team memberships
- Users' Channel memberships
- Posts (Posts in the public/private channels and also replies to those posts)
