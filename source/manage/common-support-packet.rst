Use the System Console to generate a Mattermost Support Packet that includes configuration information, logs, plugin details, and data on external dependencies. Confidential data, such as passwords, are automatically stripped. 

.. note:: 

   When present, the following information is santized during packet generation: ``LdapSettings.BindPassword``, ``FileSettings.PublicLinkSalt``, ``FileSettings.AmazonS3SecretAccessKey``, ``EmailSettings.SMTPPassword``, ``GitLabSettings.Secret``, ``GoogleSettings.Secret``, ``Office365Settings.Secret``, ``OpenIdSettings.Secret``, ``SqlSettings.DataSource``, ``SqlSettings.AtRestEncryptKey``, ``ElasticsearchSettings.Password``, ``All SqlSettings.DataSourceReplicas``, ``All SqlSettings.DataSourceSearchReplicas``, ``MessageExportSettings.GlobalRelaySettings.SmtpPassword``, ``ServiceSettings.GfycatApiSecret``, and ``ServiceSettings.SplitKey``.

To generate a Support Packet:

1. Go to the System Console, and select **Commercial Support** from the System Console menu.

2. Select **Download Support Packet**. A zip file is downloaded to the local machine.

   A Mattermost Support Packet can contain up to five files:

   - ``mattermost.log``
   - ``plugins.json``
   - ``sanitized_config.json``
   - ``support_packet.yaml``
   - ``warning.txt`` (present when issues are encountered during packet generation)

   You'll be notified if any packet files are unavailable during packet generation. See the ``warning.txt`` file for details.

3. Plugins are not sanitized during packet generation. Sanitize any confidential details in the ``plugin.json`` file before sending the support packet to Mattermost. 

.. note::

  When sanitizing Support Packet data, replace details with example strings that contain the same special characters if possible, as special characters are common causes of configuration errors.

  LDAP groups are not included during support packet generation. Only ``LDAP Version`` and ``LDAP Vendor`` are included when present. These values are included in the ``support_packet.yaml`` file.
