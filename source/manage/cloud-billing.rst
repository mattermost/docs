From February 2, 2023, Mattermost Cloud Professional and Enterprise plans are offered as an annual subscription service. Existing customers billed monthly will no longer be supported as of July 27, 2023.

.. note:: 
   
   If you have an existing Cloud Professional monthly subscription, you have until July 27, 2023 to switch to annual billing:
   
   1. Go to **System Console > Subscription**. In the **Switch to an annual plan today** section select **Learn More**. A minimum of ten seats is required.
   2. Fill in your payment information.
   3. Select **Switch to annual billing**

To upgrade to a Professional plan within Mattermost, select **View plans** in the header or in the System Console. For Enterprise plans, you need to `contact sales </https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/>`__.

When you upgrade, you'll need to indicate the number of user seats you have - these are active users who'll be using Mattermost. This can't be less than the current total number of active users in your workspace but you can buy more seats to accommodate active user growth. You'll be billed immediately for the cost of the annual subscription.

As this is an annual subscription, it renews automatically. You'll be reminded of the renewal ahead of time. You can choose to opt-out of automatic renewal. In this case, you'll be notified ahead of time, so that your subscription doesn't lapse.

Please see the `Cloud subscriptions </about/cloud-subscriptions.html>`__ documentation for more detailed information on the Cloud billing process.
