From February 2023, Mattermost Cloud Professional and Enterprise plans are offered as an annual subscription service.

.. note:: 
   If you have an existing Cloud Professional monthly subscription you can keep it as is and are not required to switch to an annual subscription. If you'd like to switch, please follow these steps.

To upgrade to a Professional plan within Mattermost, select **View plans** in the header. For Enterprise plans, you need to [contact sales](https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/).

When you upgrade, you'll need to indicate the number of user seats you have - these are active users who'll be using Mattermost. This can't be less than the current total number of active users in your workspace but you can buy more seats to accommodate active user growth. You'll be billed immediately for the cost of the annual subscription.

As this is an annual subscription, it renews automatically. You'll be reminded of the renewal ahead of time.

You can choose to opt-out of automatic renewal. In this case, you'll be notified ahead of time, so that your subscription doesn't lapse.

Mattermost Cloud workspaces can be used free forever with Cloud Free.

Please see the `Cloud subscriptions </about/cloud-subscriptions.html>`__ documentation for more detailed information on the Cloud billing process.
