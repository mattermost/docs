Mattermost Cloud Professional and Enterprise plans are offered as an annual subscription service.

You can upgrade to a Professional plan in the product self-serve. For Enterprise plans, you need to [contact sales](https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/). 
When you upgrade, you can indicate how many number of user seats you'd like to purchase, which cannot be less than the current total number of active users in your workspace. You will be billed immediately for the cost of the annual subscription.

Your subscription renews automatically unless you choose to opt-out of renewing.



Mattermost Cloud workspaces can be used free forever with Cloud Free.

Please see the `Cloud subscriptions </about/cloud-subscriptions.html>`__ documentation for more detailed information on the Cloud billing process.
