1. Enable system-wide notifications by going to **System Console > Site Configuration > System-wide notifications**, and setting **Enable system-wide notifications** to **true**.
2. In the **Banner Text** field, enter the notification text you want to share in channels.
3. Specify the background and text colors for the banner.
4. By default, users can dismiss the banner until they log in again or until you update the banner. To prevent users from dismissing the banner, set **Allow Banner Dismissal** to **false**.
5. Select **Save**.

Update the banner by either changing the text of the banner or by re-enabling the banner after it's been disabled. 

To disable the banner, set **Enable Announcement Banner** to **false**.
