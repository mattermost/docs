FINRA Compliance
=================

Mattermost Enterprise and Enterprise Advanced features help users to meet the `cybersecurity requirements of the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) <https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/cybersecurity>`_ as part of a customer's existing operational systems, including technology governance, system change management, risk assessments, technical controls, incident response, vendor management, data loss prevention, and staff training.

FINRA reviews a firm’s ability to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive customer information. This includes reviewing each firm’s compliance with SEC regulations, including:

- Regulation `S-P (17 CFR §248.30) <https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-248/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR83262a0bce5ffaa/section-248.30>`_, which requires firms to adopt written policies and procedures to protect customer information against cyber-attacks and other forms of unauthorized access.

- Regulation `S-ID (17 CFR §248.201-202) <https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-248>`_, which outlines a firm's duties regarding the detection, prevention, and mitigation of identity theft.

- The `Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR §240.17a-4(f)) <https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-240>`_, which requires firms to preserve electronically stored records in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format.

Mattermost supports FINRA compliance as part of a customer's integrated operations in the following ways:

- **Continuous archiving:** Configuration as a non-rewriteable, non-erasable system of record for all messages and files entered into the system. Moreover, automated compliance exports and integration support for Smarsh/Actiance and Global Relay provide third-party eDiscovery options.
- **Secure deployment:** Deployment within private, public, and on-premises networks with existing FINRA-compliant safeguards and infrastructure to protect customer information from cyber attack.
- **Support for intrusion detection:** Ability to support multi-layered intrusion detection from authentication systems to application servers to database access, including configuration of proxy, application, and database logging to deeply audit system interactions.
- **Multi-layered disaster recovery:** High Availability configuration, automated data back up, and enterprise information archiving integration to prevent data loss and recover from disaster.
