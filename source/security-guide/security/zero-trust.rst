Zero Trust with Mattermost
============================

Mattermost helps organizations adopt and implement Zero Trust principles to safeguard their mission-critical communications and collaboration. 

For security teams, Mattermost’s zero-trust-first approach ensures consistent compliance with organizational risk policies by automating key governance processes like incident response or data lifecycle management.

Unlike traditional security approaches, Zero Trust assumes every user and system may be a potential threat. Mattermost implements this paradigm by offering customizable, secure solutions that protect sensitive communication workflows from both internal and external risks.

This document outlines how Mattermost supports the core tenets of Zero Trust, for organizations of different sizes, including `Identity and access management <#identity-and-access-management>`__, `Continuous monitoring <#continuous-monitoring>`__, `Deployment and host control <#deployment-and-host-control>`__, `Encryption <#encryption>`__, `Micro-segmentation <#micro-segmentation>`__,  `Multi-factor authentication <#multi-factor-authentication-mfa>`__,  `Data management <#data-management>`__, and `Incident response <#incident-response>`__. Links to detailed documentation resources are provided below.

MFA ensures that unauthorized users are denied access even if passwords are compromised, reducing the risk of account breaches.  

Alternatively, often enforced through the identity provider (IDP).

Data management
---------------

Data management directly addresses how sensitive information is managed, controlled, and safeguarded at every stage of the data lifecycle. Proper data retention practices ensure that data is not only securely stored but also that it is not retained longer than necessary, thereby reducing risks.  

By retaining data only for the duration that it is needed and then securely disposing of it, the exposure to malicious activity or unauthorized access is significantly reduced. Even if attackers gain access, their exposure is minimized. The less data stored, the smaller the "footprint" for potential exploitation:

E-Discovery capabilities help organizations meet compliance expectations for legal audits under frameworks like GDPR or HIPAA without sacrificing secure collaboration workflows.
- `Archiving Inactive Teams or Channels <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members.html#archive-a-team>`_ & `Unarchive Channels <https://docs.mattermost.com/end-user-guide/collaborate/archive-unarchive-channels.html>`_: Reduces the potential attack surface by securely deactivating and storing inactive resources, minimizing both live data exposure and the likelihood of exploitation. This approach ensures adherence to security best practices while maintaining the ability to securely restore resources if needed.

Incident response
------------------

Incident response ensures that organizations can effectively detect, investigate, and respond to security threats within a framework that assumes no entity, whether inside or outside the network, should be trusted by default. Incident response is the operational arm that ensures that organizations are vigilant, prepared, and capable of protecting themselves in a dynamic and evolving threat landscape.
