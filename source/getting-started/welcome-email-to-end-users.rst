Subject: New Communication Platform - Mattermost


Hi all,
 
As some of you already know, we are moving to Mattermost as our communication platform. Mattermost is collaboration software you can use to talk, share files, and collaborate on projects or initiatives. Mattermost also integrates with many of the apps that you use every day, like **[add apps]**.  

We are moving to Mattermost because it will host all our communication in one place, is instantly searchable and available from all your devices.

Some of the major benefits of using Mattermost are:

- Direct 1:1 and group messaging

- Channels for topic-based, group-based, or meeting-based chat

- Streamlined collaboration on projects

- Reduced email clutter

- Searching across messages and channels

- Sharing files

To get started:

1. Open a browser on your computer, go to **[Mattermost URL]** and log in with your **[LDAP/AD, SAML, Google, etc]** credentials. Remember to bookmark the URL so you can use it to log in next time.

2. `Download <https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`__ the Mattermost apps for desktop and mobile. See the `Channels documentation <https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/welcome-to-mattermost-messaging.html>`__ for details on how to get up and running quickly.


3. Start messaging!
