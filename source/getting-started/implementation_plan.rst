2 System Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides a brief overview of the system to be implemented, including a description of the system and its organization.

2.1 System Description
.........................................

Mattermost is a messaging solution designed to remove friction for inter-organizational communications. You are implementing Mattermost in order to:

1. **[STATE REASON]**

2. **[STATE REASON]**

3. **[STATE REASON]**

In this implementation, you are planning to deploy Mattermost to **[NUMBER OF USERS]** users on the following teams:

1. **[TEAM 1]**

2. **[TEAM 2]**

3. **[TEAM 3]**


2.2  System Organization
.........................................

A Mattermost Enterprise E20 implementation consists of the following system components:

 - **Mattermost Server**
   - The Mattermost Server is a single binary that includes the RESTful JSON web service, authentication client, authentication provider, notification service, and data management service. The Mattermost Server can be deployed in stand-alone or high availability mode where two or more servers are clustered together using gossip protocol and a proxy server that routes traffic from client applications to healthy servers in the cluster.
 - **Mattermost Database**
   - A MySQL or PostgreSQL database in stand-alone or high-availability configurations (master with read replicas). When choosing the database, consider the `inherent search limitations of the database type <https://docs.mattermost.com/install/requirements.html#database-software>`__ and whether `Elasticsearch <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/elasticsearch.html>`__ is most appropriate for your deployment.
 - **Mattermost Push Notification Service**
   - Hosted or on-prem service that pushes notifications to Mattermost Android and Mattermost iOS mobile applications.
 - **Mattermost Client Applications**
   - Client applications are available for Mattermost for the following platforms: Android, iOS, Windows, OSX, and Linux (Beta).
 - **Mattermost Web Client**
   - Mattermost users can use their favorite Web browser to connect to their Mattermost server in place of the Mattermost mobile and desktop applications.
 - **Proxy Server**
   - The use of a proxy server (NGINX, Apache, HAProxy, ELB, etc.) is recommended with Mattermost to obtain the benefits of: SSL termination, HTTP to HTTPS redirection, port mapping :80 to :8065, and the creation of standard request logs.

The following diagram is a high-level illustration of the Mattermost platform and how its various components interact with each other within a network:

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/deployment.html

A recommended installation of Mattermost Enterprise E20 configured with a redundant, highly available, highly scalable mode, with application (Mattermost Server) and database high availability features enabled, will require the following physical, or virtual, servers:

+-------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+
| Task              | Qty     | CPU           | Memory | Storage  |
+===================+=========+===============+========+==========+
| Mattermost Server | 2       | 2 vCPUs/cores | 4 GB   | 45-90 GB |
+-------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+
| Database Server   | 2       | 2 vCPUs/cores | 8 GB   | 100 GB   |
+-------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+
| Proxy             | 2       | 1 vCPUs/cores | 4 GB   | 10 GB    |
+-------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+

3.3.3 Prepare Deployment Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build out the required deployment environments (development, staging, production, etc.) and implement configuration management (using a tool like Chef, Puppet, Salt, etc.)

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/install/requirements.html

3.3.4 Install Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install and configure Mattermost and its component software (MySQL or PostgreSQL, Nginx or another proxy, etc.)

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/health-check.html

3.3.6 Bulk Load Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Large quantities of data can be imported from a JSON file into Mattermost at the command line using the bulk loading feature. This feature is most suitable for migrating data from an existing messaging system, or for pre-populating a new installation with data.

You can import the following data types:

 - Teams
 - Channels (Public & Private)
 - Users
 - Users’ Team memberships
 - Users’ Channel memberships
 - Users’ notification preferences
 - Posts (regular, non-reply posts)
 - Direct Message and Group Message channels
 - Direct Messages and Group Messages

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/bulk-loading.html 

3.3.7 Implement Backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implement backup procedures to protect data stored within the Mattermost database, files uploaded by users, and the Mattermost config.json file.

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/backup.html

3.3.8 Implement Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mattermost E20 supports integrated health and performance monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. A guide to the statistics collected and reported on is available in the reference below:

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/metrics.html

3.3.9 AD/LDAP Setup (E10, E20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mattermost supports AD/LDAP integration for user authentication and user attribute syncing. 

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-ldap.html

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/auth.html 

3.3.11 SAML Single-Sign-On (E20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mattermost can be configured to act as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider. Mattermost officially supports Okta, OneLogin and Microsoft ADFS as the identity providers (IDPs).

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml.html

3.3.12 Train Administrators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Train administrators on the tasks required to manage Mattermost.

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administrator.html

3.3.13 Update Legal & Support Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mattermost has configuration settings for the terms of service, privacy policy, and support URLs and emails. It is highly recommended that you modify these in your configuration so that your users have the correct legal information and can contact administrators to resolve account issues. You can find these under **System Console > Legal and Support**.

3.5 Security
.........................................

If appropriate for the system to be implemented, include an overview of the system security features and requirements during the implementation.

3.5.1     System Security Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mattermost platform will be secured in the following ways:

 - Mattermost will be hosted entirely on-premises behind your company firewall with access restricted to VPN connections;
 - Mobile access to Mattermost will be further restricted by the use of multi-factor authorization;
 - Transmissions to and from Mattermost will be encrypted using TLS;
 - Encryption-at-rest will be applied using your company's standards;
 - Mattermost’s integrity and audit controls store a complete history of messages, including edits and deletes, along with all files uploaded. User interface actions for “deleting” messages and channels remove the data only from the user interface; the data is retained within your database. If your compliance guidelines require it, you can turn off users’ ability to edit and delete their messages after they are posted.
 - Mattermost will be protected against brute force attacks by its rate limiting API;
 - Authentication to Mattermost will be controlled using your company's Active Directory/LDAP/SAML directory server. 

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/security.html

3.5.2     Security During Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section addresses security issues specifically related to the implementation effort, if any. For example, if LAN servers or workstations will be installed at a site with sensitive data preloaded on non-removable hard disk drives, address how security would be provided for the data on these devices during shipping, transport, and installation because theft of the devices could compromise the sensitive data.
