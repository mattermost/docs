1 Introduction
--------------

1.1 Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost is an open source, private cloud alternative to proprietary SaaS collaboration solutions designed to offer organizations superior control, data sovereignty, configurability, freedom from lock-in, and enhanced security by keeping vital communications behind your firewall. You've chosen to implement Mattermost in our supported `editions and offerings:`_

.. _`editions and offerings:`: https://docs.mattermost.com/about/editions-and-offerings.html

The purpose of this Implementation Plan is to:

- Describe the solution to be deployed;
- Outline the process for implementing the solution (key personnel, tasks, schedule, etc.);
- Identify support required during the implementation process.

2 System overview
-----------------

This section provides a brief overview of the system to be implemented, including a description of the system and its organization.

2.1 System description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost is a collaboration solution designed to remove organizational friction. You're implementing Mattermost in order to:

1. **[STATE REASON]**
2. **[STATE REASON]**
3. **[STATE REASON]**

In this implementation, you are planning to deploy Mattermost to **[NUMBER OF USERS]** users on the following teams:

1. **[TEAM 1]**
2. **[TEAM 2]**
3. **[TEAM 3]**

2.2  System organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Mattermost Enterprise implementation consists of the following system components:

- **Mattermost Server**
  - The Mattermost Server is a single binary that includes the RESTful JSON web service, authentication client, authentication provider, notification service, and data management service. The Mattermost Server can be deployed in stand-alone or high availability mode where two or more servers are clustered together using gossip protocol and a proxy server that routes traffic from client applications to healthy servers in the cluster.
- **Mattermost Database**
  - A PostgreSQL database in stand-alone or high-availability configurations (master with read replicas). When choosing the database, consider the `inherent search limitations of the database type </install/requirements.html#database-software>`__ and whether `Elasticsearch </scale/elasticsearch.html>`__ is most appropriate for your deployment.
- **Mattermost Push Notification Service**
  - Hosted or on-premise service that pushes notifications to Mattermost Android and Mattermost iOS mobile applications.
- **Mattermost Client Applications**
  - Client applications are available for Mattermost for the following platforms: Android, iOS, Windows, OSX, and Linux (Beta).
- **Mattermost Web Client**
  - Mattermost users can use their favorite Web browser to connect to their Mattermost server in place of the Mattermost mobile and desktop applications.
- **Proxy Server**
  - The use of a proxy server (NGINX, Apache, HAProxy, ELB, etc.) is recommended with Mattermost to obtain the benefits of: SSL termination, HTTP to HTTPS redirection, port mapping :80 to :8065, and the creation of standard request logs.

The following diagram is a high-level illustration of the Mattermost platform and how its various components interact with each other within a network:

3.5 Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If appropriate for the system to be implemented, include an overview of the system security features and requirements during the implementation.

3.5.1 System security features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mattermost platform will be secured in the following ways:

- Mattermost will be hosted entirely on-premises behind your company firewall with access restricted to VPN connections;
- Mobile access to Mattermost will be further restricted by the use of multi-factor authorization;
- Transmissions to and from Mattermost will be encrypted using TLS;
- Encryption-at-rest will be applied using your company's standards;
- Mattermost’s integrity and audit controls store a complete history of messages, including edits and deletes, along with all files uploaded. User interface actions for “deleting” messages and channels remove the data only from the user interface; the data is retained within your database. If your compliance guidelines require it, you can turn off users’ ability to edit and delete their messages after they are posted.
- Mattermost will be protected against brute force attacks by its rate limiting API;
- Authentication to Mattermost will be controlled using your company's Active Directory/LDAP/SAML directory server. 

**Reference**: https://docs.mattermost.com/about/security.html
