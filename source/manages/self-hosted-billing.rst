Self-hosted billing
===================

Mattermost Professional and Enterprise plans are offered as an annual subscription service.

You'll be billed for registered users in your deployment. A registered user is a user who has an account and doesn't show as **Inactive** in **System Console > User Management > Users**. Registered users will count towards your monthly invoice each day as long as they're not deactivated in the billing period.

Please see the `self-hosted subscriptions documentation <https://docs.mattermost.com/about/self-hosted-subscriptions.html#buy-a-subscription>`_ for more detailed information.
