`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co>`__ provides enterprise-scale deployments with optimized search performance and prevents performance degradation and timeouts. Elasticsearch allows you to search large volumes of data quickly, in near real-time, by creating and managing an index of post data. Mattermost’s implementation uses Elasticsearch v7.x as a distributed, RESTful search engine supporting highly efficient database searches in a :doc:`cluster environment </scale/high-availability-cluster>`. Visit the :doc:`Mattermost Elasticsearch product documentation </scale/elasticsearch>` for deployment and configuration details.

Performance monitoring support enables a Mattermost server to track system health for large Enterprise deployments through integrations with `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__ and `Grafana <https://grafana.org/>`__. These integrations support data collection from several Mattermost servers, which is particularly useful if you’re running Mattermost :doc:`in high availability mode </scale/high-availability-cluster>`. Once you’re tracking system health, you can :doc:`set up performance alerts </scale/performance-alerting>` on your Grafana dashboard. Visit the :doc:`Mattermost Performance Monitoring product documentation </scale/performance-monitoring>` for installation details.
