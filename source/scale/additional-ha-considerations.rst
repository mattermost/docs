`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co>`__ provides enterprise-scale deployments with optimized search performance and prevents performance degradation and timeouts. Elasticsearch allows you to search large volumes of data quickly, in near real-time, by creating and managing an index of post data. Mattermost’s implementation uses Elasticsearch v7.x as a distributed, RESTful search engine supporting highly efficient database searches in a `cluster environment </scale/high-availability-cluster.html>`__. Visit the `Mattermost` Elasticsearch product documentation </scale/elasticsearch.html>`__ for deployment and configuration details.

Performance monitoring support enables a Mattermost server to track system health for large Enterprise deployments through integrations with `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__ and `Grafana <https://grafana.org/>`__. These integrations support data collection from several Mattermost servers, which is particularly useful if you’re running Mattermost `in high availability mode </scale/high-availability-cluster.html>`__. Once you’re tracking system health, you can `set up performance alerts </scale/performance-alerting.html>`__ on your Grafana dashboard. Visit the `Mattermost Performance Monitoring product documentation </scale/performance-monitoring.html>`__ for details on installation details.
