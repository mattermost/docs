The Mattermost Metrics plugin is an alternative tool to collect application metrics from Mattermost that doesn't require you to install and integrate `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__ and `Grafana <https://grafana.org/>`__ with Mattermost. 

The Metrics plugin can be installed on Mattermost versions from v6.3 and collects and stores the :doc:`same performance monitoring metrics </scale/performance-monitoring-metrics>` as Prometheus, without having to deploy these third-party tools. Data is collected every minute and is stored where the plugin is running. The data is synchronized to either a cloud-based or local file store every hour, and retained for 15 days. 

Using the Mattermost Metrics plugin, you can download and share the collected data with Mattermost to understand application performance, troubleshoot system stability and performance, as well as inform route cause analysis.

Install the Mattermost Metrics plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest version from the `Mattermost release page <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-metrics/releases>`__.
2. In the System Console, go to **Plugins > Plugin Management** to upload the plugin file. Alternatively, you can place the plugin file in the Mattermost server's plugin directory manually.
3. Enable the plugin in the System Console.

Furthermore, to use the dump file generated by the plugin, you can simply clone the `Dockprom <https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockpromo>`__ repository. Change the Prometheus data volume to point to the dump that you just downloaded. The downloaded file is compressed, so to be able to use it, you need to decompress it first.

The volume configuration for Prometheus should look like the code below in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file:

.. code:: yaml

    volumes:
      - ./prometheus:/etc/prometheus
      - /Path/To/Dump/Directory:/prometheus/data

Once you set this up, run ``docker-compose`` as described in `Dockprom Repository <https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom?tab=readme-ov-file#install>`__. 

You can also use our `Mattermost Performance Monitoring v2 <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15582>`__ dashboard by simply importing it into Grafana.

1. Open Grafana (``<localhost>:3000`` by default) and then log into it. 
2. Once you log in, go to the **Plus** |plus-icon| icon on the left sidebar, and then select **Import**. 
3. Enter the dashboard ID (``15582``) in the **Grafana.com Dashboard** field, and then select **Load** to fetch the dashboard.
