Scale Mattermost up to 2000 users
=================================

.. include:: ../_static/badges/ent-selfhosted.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

This page describes the Mattermost reference architecture designed for a minimum load of 100 concurrent users and up to 2000 concurrent users. Unsure which reference architecture to use? See the :doc:`scaling for enterprise </scale/scaling-for-enterprise>` documentation for details.

- **High Availability**: Required
- **Database Configuration**: writer, reader

.. note::
    Usage of CPU, RAM, and storage space can vary significantly based on user behavior. These hardware recommendations are based on traditional deployments and may grow or shrink depending on how active your users are.

Estimated storage per user, per month
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../scale/estimated-storage-per-user-per-month.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

Example
~~~~~~~

A 2000-person team with medium usage (with a safety factor of 2x) would require between 120GB :sup:`1` and 600GB :sup:`2` of free space per annum.

:sup:`1` 2000 users * 5 MB * 12 months * 2x safety factor

:sup:`2` 2000 users * 25 MB * 12 months * 2x safety factor

We strongly recommend that you review storage utilization at least quarterly to ensure adequate free space is available.
