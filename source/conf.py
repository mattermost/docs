# How to add redirects for docs.mattermost.com:
# A redirect is required when an existing product documentation page is moved to a new sub-directory, to another information site altogether, OR when the file # is archived because it's no longer needed. Redirects defined here ensure that existing links to these changed pages take the user to the correct destination # page. Many of the links below are the result of the information architecture overhaul completed in FY22 Q2.
# All redirects in the following are organized alphabetically for easy scanning and management based on the origin URL (the URL to the left of the colon). 
# Please take care to ensure that alphabetical order is maintained as new redirects are added. See a mistake? Please feel free to fix it!
# Before adding a new redirect, please search to confirm that the redirect you want isn't already specified below. 
# Add the new redirect in the appropriate section, based on its path. 
# For page heading redirects, use the format "directory/filename.html": "full-URL-path-to-new-destination.html",
# For mid-page redirects (also known as section title redirects), use the format "directory/filename.html#section-title": "full-URL-path-to-new-destination.html",
# Ensure that all redirects end in a comma, except for the very last redirect.
