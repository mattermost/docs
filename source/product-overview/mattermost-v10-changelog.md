  - Fixed an issue with PSD file previews.

  - User's actual authentication method is now validated before processing authentication type switch.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v10.8, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Highlights

#### New Enterprise Advanced License
 - Added support for a new Enterprise Advanced license. This new license is supported starting v10.9 and is supported on PostgreSQL only. Enterprise plugins need to be updated to support the new license (most of which are pre-packaged in v10.9).

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Consolidated all channel editing functionality into a single, accessible modal located in the channel header menu. Users can now update channel names, URL slugs, convert to private, modify/add a purpose and header (with a live markdown preview), manage channel banners, and archive the channel—all in one place. Updates include safeguards for unsaved edits, improved URL-slug editing, and enhanced keyboard and navigation accessibility.
 - Pre-packaged MS Teams plugin [v2.2.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams/releases/tag/v2.2.1).
 - Pre-packaged Playbooks plugin [v2.2.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/releases/tag/v2.2.0) and [v1.41.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/releases/tag/v1.41.1).
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.8.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.8.0).
 - Pre-packaged Jira plugin version [v4.3.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases/tag/v4.3.0).
 - Pre-packaged Metrics plugin version [v0.7.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-metrics/releases/tag/v0.7.0).
 - Introduced a configurable [channel banner feature](https://docs.mattermost.com/end-user-guide/collaborate/display-channel-banners.html) for channel admins, visible across desktop, web, and mobile platforms. This feature requires an Enterprise Advanced license.
 - Added more descriptive page titles to the login, account creation, and password reset pages.
 - Improved the **Drafts** list by implementing virtualization.
 - Enhanced the behavior for reporting issues in the platform.
 - Introduced minor layout tweaks in theme settings for improved usability.

#### Administration
 - Added support for user attributes for Enterprise Advanced licensed servers. Defined policies that automatically grant channel memberships based on user attributes. Membership updates happen automatically when user attributes change — no need for manual role adjustments.
 - Added Policy Management user interface and API to easily create and manage attribute-based rules via an admin interface.
 - Added support for AES-256-GCM encryption in SAML.
 - Updated the email validation logic to ensure Mattermost no longer accepts email addresses enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., ``<billy@example.com>``). Although these comply with RFC 5322 and RFC 6532 standards, they introduce unnecessary complexity. If a user already has such an email in your installation, they may face issues like being unable to update their profile. To resolve this, the email must be modified manually using the command: ``mmctl user email "<affecteduser@domain.com>" affecteduser@domain.com``.
 - Added a license load metric to the **About** screen to display current license usage.
 - Upgraded the logr dependency to version 2.0.22.
 - Removed telemetry tracking from Redux selectors.
 - Made it possible to [view JSON logs in plain text](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/configure/reporting-configuration-settings.html#server-logs) within the **System Console**.
 - Enhanced the **System Console** search functionality to include all log fields.
 - Enhanced error reporting related to cluster management.
 - Added an LDAP setting to re-add removed members.
 - Added support for SSO while Mattermost is embedded in an iframe.
 - Set the Custom Profile Attributes feature flag to ``true`` by default.

#### Performance
 - Optimized the team-switching operation by eliminating unnecessary calls to retrieve channels and channel members.
 - Improved websocket re-opening speed when network conditions change.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed various issues on the **Create Team** screen.
 - Fixed several accessibility issues across the login process, account creation, and MFA setup.
 - Fixed an issue where horizontal rule (HR) elements were not visible in preview mode in the right-hand sidebar (RHS).

 - Fixed various accessibility issues in the **Browse Channels** modal.

 - Fixed possible deadlocks when updating ``SidebarCategories`` and ``SidebarChannels`` tables.
 - Fixed an issue where unreads from deleted teams would display in the titlebar/Desktop App.
 - Fixed an issue with ``icon_emoji`` property not working for webhook posts.

### Known Issues
 - Permissions lists exceed content area for **All Members** and **System Admins** in the System Console [MM-64417](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-64417).
 - Setting the license file location through an environment variable still gives the option to upload a new license through the System Console, resulting in the license being overwritten by the one set through the environment variable. See this [knowledge base article](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/33911983851284-System-console-still-displays-old-license-after-uploading-a-new-one) on how to resolve this issue.

```

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin version [v1.6.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.6.0). 
 - Webapp plugin loading and footer are now disabled if ``MMEMBED`` cookie is set.

 - Added a browser window title to the **Scheduled Posts** tab. The title is **Scheduled - <team name>**, using the same pattern as the **Drafts** tab.

#### Administration
 - Added a new System Console page called **Embedding** which allows frame ancestor domains to be specified when embedding Mattermost in other web sites. Note, ``teams.microsoft.com`` is no longer added automatically to the frame ancestors list.
 - The Channel Export plugin is removed from the transitional package list as it is now pre-packaged.
 - Removed unnecessary log messages by checking the license before calling to retrieve groups.
 - Made configuration location in the Support Packet human-readable.
 - Added advanced audit and notifications logs to the Support Packet.
 - Added log information to LDAP sync about ``include_removed_members`` option.
 - Upgraded ``react-select`` from v3.0.3 to v5.9.0.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with the alignment of the draft list when scheduled posts are disabled.
 - Fixed an issue where threads created by users were auto-followed on reply by the creator when they left the channel.
 - Fixed an issue where muted channels in other teams would show their mentions in the title bar.
 - Fixed an issue where messages from new channels in other teams wouldn't show up until a refresh.
 - Fixed an issue with the scrolling behavior when navigating the Direct Message list using UP/DOWN arrow keys.
 - Fixed a few minor bugs with websocket reconnection logic in the webapp.
 - Fixed an issue where DND statuses did not expire at the expiry time displayed in the app.
 - Fixed an issue where the group mentions permission was missing.
 - Fixed an issue where a system bot reply to a command entered in a thread was also posted in the channel.
 - Fixed an issue where the channel member menu could open in the wrong direction.
 - Fixed an issue where the edit post textbox sized incorrectly with the Grammarly browser extension installed.
 - Fixed an issue where onclick was missing in the channel header text, thus enabling hashtag, link, and mention clicks.
 - Fixed an issue with jobs in a High Availability environment, where two job servers would take the same job.
 - Fixed an issue where there was inconsistent behaviour on removing non-group members from group synced teams and channels.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``MetricsSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``ClientSideUserIds`` where users can set the user IDs that they want to track for client-side webapp metrics. The total number of userIDs have been capped to 5 for performance reasons, otherwise Prometheus gets overwhelmed with high label cardinality. We recommend modifying this list infrequently to ensure Prometheus performance. 
 - Under ``CacheSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``RedisCachePrefix`` has been added which can be used to add a prefix to all Redis cache keys. 
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added a new configuration setting ``FrameAncestors`` to allow frame ancestor domains to be specified when embedding Mattermost in other web sites. 

#### Changes to Enterprise plans:
 - Under ``NativeAppSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added new settings to enable mobile biometric authentication prompt, jailbreak / root detection and to prevent screen captures. The settings are: ``MobileEnableBiometrics`` (default: false), ``MobilePreventScreenCapture`` (default: false), ``MobileJailbreakProtection`` (default: false).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Support for PostgreSQL v11 and v12 have been removed. The new minimum PostgreSQL version is v13+. See the [minimum supported PostgreSQL version policy](https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/software-hardware-requirements.html#minimum-postgresql-database-support-policy) documentation for details.
 - System Console statistics now perform faster on PostgreSQL. The ``MaxUsersForStatistics`` configuration setting now only disables the **User counts with posts** chart, while all other stats remain unaffected. The other stats remain unaffected because that configuration value is no longer needed to disable the other queries since they are always fast now. Post and file counts update daily, so they may not always reflect real-time data. Advanced stats, such as line charts and plugin data, are now hidden until clicked, reducing load time. No performance improvements apply to MySQL since it's scheduled for full deprecation in v11. We recommend migrating to PostgreSQL for better performance and long-term support. Migration times: On a system with 12M posts, and 1M fileinfo entries, the migration takes 15s, but could take several minutes depending on the server's table sizes and database specs. This migration is non-locking. Note that there is no migration for MySQL deployments because this optimization is only applicable for PostgreSQL. See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v10.5, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Boards plugin version [v9.1.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-boards/releases/tag/v9.1.1). 
 - Pre-packaged Playbooks plugin version [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/releases/tag/v2.1.1).
 - Pre-packaged Copilot plugin version [v1.1.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ai/releases/tag/v1.1.1).
 - Pre-packaged MS Teams plugin version [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams/releases/tag/v2.1.1).
 - Pre-packaged Jira plugin version [v4.2.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases/tag/v4.2.1).
 - Upgraded Ukrainian language to official.

#### Administration
 - Unlicensed server limits have been updated: a soft limit of 2500 users now results in a banner notification visible by admins, and a 5K hard limit that prevents the creation or activation of users until the user count is reduced below the hard limit.
 - Removed the automatic Elasticsearch/OpenSearch channel index schema check. As a result, admins will no longer receive Direct Message alerts to notify that their ``elasticsearch`` channel index is out of date.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the email address in Mattermost would not get updated if the one in SAML changed. 
 - Fixed an issue where deleted messages would still show thread replies in the channel. 
 - Fixed an error that could occur when navigating away from the threads screen. 
 - Fixed an issue where INFO level logging for ``DoActionRequest POST`` requests was missing. 
 - Fixed an issue where users did not have the ability to toggle the switcher menu in the global header using the **SPACE** and **ENTER** keys while the product branding was in focus. 
 - Fixed "An error has occurred" bar being shown with developer mode disabled. 
 - Fixed an issue where deleted threads would get stuck in the thread viewer. 
 - Fixed an issue where the channel file count was incorrect due to files not actually being submitted as part of a post. 
 - Fixed a crash issue in the integration action system. 
 - Fixed an issue where a currently selected thread was shown in the **Unreads** pane.
 - Fixed an issue with mmctl preventing the logging of a harmless debug-level "error". 
 - Fixed an issue where the unread count in your team sidebar may be out of sync when following/unfollowing threads. 
 - Fixed an issue with Bulk Export: Exports will no longer stop when they encounter a missing file. 

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
- Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``conig.json``:
  - A new configuration setting ``EnableWebHubChannelIteration`` was added, which allows a user to control the performance of websocket broadcasting. By default, this setting is turned off. If it is turned on, it improves the websocket broadcasting performance at the expense of poor performance when users join/leave a channel. We don't recommended turning this on unless you have at least 200,000 concurrent users actively using Mattermost.
- Removed ``EnableOpenTracing`` to remove the unused ``opentracing`` support. 

### API Changes
 - Added audit logging to the ``SearchPosts`` API.
 - Added a ``metrics`` tag to ``client_perf`` endpoint.

### Open Source Components
 - Added and removed several components.

### Go Version
 - v10.6 is built with Go ``v1.22.6``.

### Known Issues
 - Setting the license file location through an environment variable still gives the option to upload a new license through the System Console, resulting in the license being overwritten by the one set through the environment variable. See this [knowledge base article](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/33911983851284-System-console-still-displays-old-license-after-uploading-a-new-one) on how to resolve this issue.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.

- **10.5.0, released 2025-02-14**
  - Original 10.5.0 release.

### Compatibility
 - Updated minimum Safari version to 17.4+ and minimum Firefox version to 119+.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Mattermost versions v10.5.0 and v10.5.1 include a bundled Jira plugin (v4.2.0) that contains a bug which may cause plugin configuration settings to disappear. We strongly advise against upgrading to these versions to avoid potential disruption.  
If you have already upgraded to v10.5.0 or v10.5.1, we recommend updating the Jira plugin to version v4.2.1, or preferably, upgrading both Mattermost and the Jira plugin to their latest available versions.
 - v10.5 introduces Property System Architecture schema migration. See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) for details.
 - The Compliance Export system has been overhauled. See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) for details.
 - The Mattermost server has stopped supporting manual plugin deployment. Plugins were deployed manually when an administrator or some deployment automation copies the contents of a plugin bundle into the server's working directory. If a manual or automated deployment workflow is still required, administrators can instead prepackage the plugin bundles. See more details in [this forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/deprecation-notice-manual-plugin-deployment/21192).
 - Mattermost has stopped official Mattermost server builds for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Administrators should migrate existing Mattermost server installations to use the official Linux builds. See more details in [this forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/deprecation-notice-server-builds-for-microsoft-windows/21498).

### Breaking Changes
- The internal workings of the `PluginLinkComponent` in the web app have been changed to unmount link tooltips from the DOM by default, significantly improving performance. Plugins that register link tooltips using `registerLinkTooltipComponent` will experience changes in how tooltip components are managed—they are now only mounted when a link is hovered over or focused. As a result, plugins may need to update their components to properly handle mounting and unmounting scenarios. For example, changes were made in [mattermost-plugin-jira](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/pull/1145), where componentDidUpdate lifecycle hook was replaced with componentDidMount. If your plugin’s tooltip component is a functional React component, there is a high chance that this behavior will be handled automatically, as it would be managed by useEffect with an empty dependency array.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Boards plugin [v9.1.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-boards/releases/tag/v9.1.0).
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.5.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.5.1).
 - Pre-packaged MS Teams plugin [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
 - Pre-packaged Channel Export plugin [v1.2.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-export/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
 - Pre-packaged Jira plugin [v4.2.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/releases/tag/v4.2.0).
 - Added the ability to modify post attachments during edit.
 - The [channel bookmarks bar](https://docs.mattermost.com/end-user-guide/collaborate/manage-channel-bookmarks.html) is now hidden when there are no bookmarks in the channel. Bookmarks can now be added from the channel menu.
 - Removed the video from the onboarding checklist.
 - Improved accessibility throughout the webapp by fixing several issues around keyboard navigation and screen reader focused on modals, right-hand side and core chat functionality. 

#### Administration
 - Added the migrations, store layer and service for the Property System Architecture.
 - Added Custom Profile Attributes, an experimental Enterprise-only feature. This feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature, set the feature flag `CustomProfileAttributes`. Once enabled, administrators can access the System Properties section in the System Console to create and manage custom user profile fields. The initial release supports text fields only.
 - Added the Custom Profile Attribute fields store, app and API endpoints.
 - Introduced V2 of the Support Packet, containing improvement diagnosis information for high-availability deployments.
 - Added a new ``Fallback`` field to ``PluginSettingsSection`` that controls whether the settings defined under the section should still render as fallback when the plugin is disabled.
 - Updated the library used for tooltips throughout the app to fix a memory leak.
 - Reduced the volume of unnecessary debug logs generated during scheduled post job execution.
 - Removed ``form-data`` from @mattermost/client.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed archived filter behavior in System Console > User Management > Channels to restore the ability to exclude archived channels.
 - Fixed an issue where DMs/GMs with a `DeleteAt` non-zero value in the database might cause issues with several APIs.
 - Fixed an issue where the team sidebar's mention count could be out of sync with the thread count.
 - Fixed an issue where replies with props could not be imported.
 - Fixed an issue where ``pluginapi.store.GetReplicaDB`` returned nil if masterDB was not initialized.
 - Fixed an issue in ``SqlPostStore.PermanentDeletebyUser`` where no error was returned when 10K posts were exceeded.
 - Fixed an issue where a channel would no longer be exported for Bulk Export workflow if any of the users of a Direct or Group Message channel were permanently deleted.
 - Fixed an issue where the scroll position reset when custom emojis were requested.
 - Fixed a panic during LDAP synchronization.
 - Fixed an issue where the bulk export retention job would accidentally delete non-bulk export files and directories.
 - Fixed an issue where archived channels were not searchable with Elasticsearch/OpenSearch if ``TeamSettings.ExperimentalViewArchivedChannels`` was enabled. If there are old channels which were archived before a bulk index was run, users would need to purge indexes, and do bulk index again. Because those old archived channels are removed from the index when a bulk index is run.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Enterprise plans:
 - Under ``essageExportSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``ComplianceExportDirectoryFormat``, ``ComplianceExportPath``, ``ComplianceExportPathCLI``, ``ComplianceExportChannelBatchSizeDefault``, and ``ComplianceExportChannelHistoryBatchSizeDefault`` for compliance export overhaul.

### API Changes
 - ``GetUsersInChannelDuring`` now accepts a slice; added ``GetChannelsWithActivityDuring``.
 - Two new boolean query parameters were added to the ``api/v4/config`` endpoint:
    - ``remove_defaults`` (filters out default values).
    - ``remove_masked`` (removes masked fields). 

### Go Version
 - v10.5 is built with Go ``v1.23.12``.

### Known Issues
 - Setting the license file location through an envvar still gives the option to upload a new license through the System Console, resulting in the license being overwritten by the one set through the envvar. See this [knowledge base article](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/33911983851284-System-console-still-displays-old-license-after-uploading-a-new-one) on how to resolve this issue.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
- Under ``LocalizationSettings`` in ``config.json``:
  - Added a new ``EnableExperimentalLocales`` configuration setting that controls whether to allow the selection of experimental (e.g., in progress) languages.

#### Changes to Enterprise plans:
 - Under ``CacheSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``CacheType``: This can be either ``lru`` or ``redis``. ``lru`` is the default choice which will use the in-memory cache store that we use currently.
   - Added ``RedisAddress``: The hostname of the Redis host.
   - Added ``RedisPassword``: The password of the Redis host (can be left blank if there is no password).
   - Added ``RedisDB``: The database of the Redis host. Typically ``0``.
   - Added ``DisableClientCache``: This can be set to ``true`` if you decide to disable the client-side cache of Redis. Typically there is no need to do this in production, and this is mainly used as a test option.
 - Under ``FileSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added new ``AmazonS3StorageClass`` and ``ExportAmazonS3StorageClass``, both default to ``""`` to preserve the current behavior. Administrators may configure this storage class to the storage class required by their S3 solution.

### API Changes
 - Added a new query string to exclude threads that are not part of the team ``GET api/v4/users/{user_id:[A-Za-z0-9]+}/teams/{team_id:[A-Za-z0-9]+}/threads``.

### Websocket Event Changes
 - Added a new ``server_hostname`` field to the websocket ``HELLO`` event.

### Go Version
 - v10.4 is built with Go ``v1.22.6``.

### Known Issues
 - Setting the license file location through an envvar still gives the option to upload a new license through the System Console, resulting in the license being overwritten by the one set through the envvar. See this [knowledge base article](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/33911983851284-System-console-still-displays-old-license-after-uploading-a-new-one) on how to resolve this issue.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.

```{Important}

```

### Improvements

See [this walkthrough video](https://mattermost.com/video/mattermost-v10-3-changelog/) on some of the highlights and improvements in our latest release below.

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.3.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
 - Downgraded Traditional Chinese language to Beta.
 - Added a feature to schedule a message at a future date (Professional and Enterprise plans).
 - Copilot plugin is now installed and enabled by default.
 - Added an option to test notifications.
 - Added a new [search interface](https://docs.mattermost.com/end-user-guide/collaborate/search-for-messages.html).
 - Updated product string for clarity.
 - Removed most places where deprecated translation code is used in the web app.
 - Removed some duplicate CSS from the web app bundle.

#### Administration
 - A 200 response is now returned for HEAD requests to a sub-path rather than responding with a 302. This fixes mobile devices trying to connect to a server hosted on a sub-path.
 - Added the ``fetchMissingUsers`` option to ``PostUtils.messageHtmlToComponent`` for use by plugins.
 - Added support for exporting and importing bot users via mmctl.
 - Added a warning to mmctl for cases where a user specifies a per-page parameter that's larger than the maximum value supported.

#### Performance
 - Added Desktop App performance metrics.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with post drafts being unnecessarily saved when changing channels.
 - Fixed an issue where the Web App would feel slower to load than the Desktop App.
 - Fixed an issue where new messages from new channels wouldn't appear in the sidebar after reconnecting the websocket.
 - Fixed an issue with a link in the Compliance Monitoring page banner in the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue that no longer allowed managing user tokens via the System Console.
 - Fixed a SVG image rendering issue by setting conditional width and height attributes in ``ImagePreview`` and ``SizeAwareImage`` components.
 - Fixed an issue with the web app status not being updated correctly for the current user.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings `` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``ScheduledPosts`` to enable the feature to schedule and send message in the future.

### Go Version
 - v10.3 is built with Go ``v1.22.6``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``opensearch-project/opensearch-go`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.

### Known Issues
 - The bottom padding is missing in the edit state of a scheduled messages [MM-61722](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-61722).
 - An incorrect count is displayed in channels for scheduled messages [MM-62197](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-62197).
 - The scheduled post channel indicator sometimes ends up in a bad state [MM-62222](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-62222).
 - Scheduled messages are not removed from queued list when sent while being disconnected [MM-62229](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-62229).
 - Scheduled message date displayed for Direct Message users is sometimes incorrect [MM-62244](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-62244).
 - The new search modal doesn't autocomplete after a space [MM-62199](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-62199).
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.

See the [DCT deprecation Mattermost forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/upcoming-dct-deprecation/19275) for more details. 

```{Important}
If you upgrade from a release earlier than v10.0, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
```

### Improvements

See [this walkthrough video](https://mattermost.com/video/mattermost-v10-2-changelog/) on some of the highlights and improvements in our latest release below.

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.2.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
 - Changed the logic of ``useMilitaryTime`` to ``false`` to default to 12-hour time format unless the user's preference from ``data.Value`` is ``true``. When a notification email is sent to a user, the time should now default to the 12-hour format unless otherwise stated by the user. 
 - A warning is now shown when deleting a post or comment from a remote/shared channel.
 - Bot messages will now properly mention both users when they happen on non-bot Group Messages.
 - Updated the channel header to hide pinned posts when there aren't any in the channel.
 - Added full support for @mentions in the values of fields in [message attachments](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/message-attachments/).

#### Administration
 - Added a new URL parameter called ``permanent`` to ``DELETE /api/v4/posts/<post-id>``, and set ``permanent`` to ``true`` in order to permanently delete a post and its attachments.
 - Added Connected Workspaces (Beta) administration page to the System Console when Connected Workspaces are [enabled](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/connected-workspaces.html#enable-connected-workflows) for the server.
 - Added a team selector to accept connection invite flow in Connected Workspaces.
 - Restricted activation and deactivation of LDAP-managed users through both the System Console UI and Mattermost API.
 - Export/import improvements: added the ability to export all user preferences and flagged posts.

#### Changes to all plans:

 - Under ``NativeAppSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added a configuration setting ``MobileExternalBrowser`` that tells the Mobile app to perform SSO Authentication using the external default browser.

### Known Issues

 - Shared Channels: Direct Messages are not supported.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

 - We no longer support new installations using MySQL starting in v10. All new customers and/or deployments will only be supported with the minimum supported version of the PostgreSQL database. End of support for MySQL is targeted for Mattermost v11.
 - Apps Framework is deprecated for new installs. Please extend Mattermost using webhooks, slash commands, OAuth2 apps, and plugins.
 - Mattermost v10 introduces Playbooks v2 for all Enterprise licensed customers. Professional SKU customers may continue to use Playbooks v1 uninterrupted which will be maintained and supported until September 2025, followed by an appropriate grandfathering strategy. More detailed information and the discussion are available on the [Mattermost discussion forum](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/clarification-on-playbooks-in-mattermost-v10/20563).
 - Renamed ``Channel Moderation`` to ``Advanced Access Control`` in the channel management section in the **System Console**.
 - Renamed announcement banner feature to “system-wide notifications”.
 - Renamed “Collapsed Reply Threads” to “Threaded Discussions” in the System Console.
 - Renamed “System Roles” to “Delegated Granular Administration” in the System Console.
 - Renamed "Office 365" to "Entra ID" for SSO logins.
 - Fully deprecated the ``/api/v4/image`` endpoint when the image proxy is disabled.
 - Pre-packaged Calls plugin [v1.0.1](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-calls/releases/tag/v1.0.1). This includes breaking changes including removal of group calls from unlicensed servers in order to focus supportability and quality on licensed servers. Unlicensed servers can continue to use Calls in direct message channels, which represent the majority of activity.
 - Removed deprecated ``Config.ProductSettings``, ``LdapSettings.Trace``, and ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` configuration fields.
 - Removed deprecated ``pageSize`` query parameter from most API endpoints.
 - Deprecated the experimental Strict CSRF token enforcement. This feature will be fully removed in Mattermost v11.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with web app notifications not being shown in the **Notification Center** on Windows or Mac.
 - Fixed an issue with ``mmctl webhooks list`` to paginate past 200 results.

 - Fixed an issue where the **Edit Post Time Limit** button was not being displayed in the System Console.
 - Fixed another issue where users would not see channels they were added to/messages from those channels in clustered environments.

### config.json
New setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added a new setting ``MaximumURLLength`` to remove the hardcoded URL length limit.
 - Removed deprecated ``Config.ProductSettings``.
 - Removed ``EnablePreviewFeatures`` setting.

#### Changes to the Enterprise plan:
 - Removed deprecated ``LdapSettings.Trace`` setting.
 - Removed deprecated ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` setting.

### API Changes
 - Reduced the number of API requests made to fetch user information for Group Messages on page load.
 - User APIs now enforce username beginning with alphabetic character, matching client-side validation.
 - Added a new request parameter ``include_total_count`` to API endpoint ``GET /api/v4/hooks/incoming``.

### Go Version
 - v10.0 is built with Go ``v1.21.8``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``redis/rueidis`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.

### Known Issues
 - The cursor is not placed in the "Write to" field on login [MM-60275](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-60275).
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
