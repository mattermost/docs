See how it can support your secure, mission-critical collaboration, from Security Operations and DevSecOps pipelines to sensitive joint operations. 

As an open core platform, we maintain and secure the `Mattermost open-source project <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost>`_ to enable customers and community to vet and verify our software supply chain. Our code base regularly passes through automated security scanning, customer review and crowd-sourced security review through `Bugcrowd <https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/mattermost-mbb-public>`_ under our `responsible disclosure policy <https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/>`_.  The Mattermost open source project is used to produce Mattermost’s commercial Enterprise Edition that provides proprietary capabilities through paid subscriptions.

Mattermost Enterprise Edition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our commercial self-hosted software, Mattermost Enterprise Edition, is distributed as a compiled Linux binary that includes advanced and subscription-based features. It is offered under a `commercial license <https://mattermost.com/enterprise-edition-license/>`_ that prohibits reverse engineering or tampering with the license key mechanism used to unlock paid functionality, supporting a fair and compliant business model.

Once you’ve installed Mattermost Enterprise Edition in your preferred environment, you can run it as-is in a free mode, known as Entry, or activate a trial or subscription to unlock additional features. 

Mattermost Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost Entry gives small, forward-leaning teams a **free self-hosted Intelligent Mission Environment** to get started on improving their mission-critical secure collaborative workflows. Entry has all features of **Enterprise Advanced** with the following server-wide limitations and omissions: 

- 10,000 Channel messages history across all channels (older messages remain in the database but aren't viewable or searchable)
- 1000 Board cards\*
- 5 Active Playbook runs / month\*
- 250 Agent queries/ month\*
- 40-minute Calls\*
- 10,000 push notifications / month\*
- No Compliance features (compliance monitoring, exports, legal hold, data retention)
- No Delegated Granular System Administrative Roles 
- No High Availability (cluster-based deployment, horizontal scale, Enterprise search)
- `Community support only <https://mattermost.com/support/>`_.

\* *Limits will take effect in a future release.*

Mattermost Entry is best suited for teams less than 50 users. Organizations with larger deployments are encouraged to obtain a supported commercial subscription to ensure reliable operations and access to enterprise-grade support.

The following sections outline our paid offerings which provide commercial support and remove free limitations.

Mattermost Team Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Team Edition is a free-to-use, open source, self-hosted collaboration platform that offers the core productivity benefits of competing SaaS ChatOps solutions. It is deployed as a single Linux binary with PostgreSQL and is licensed under MIT. Team Edition is intended for small teams, hobbyists, or personal use under 250 activated users where single sign-on (SSO) is not required. It is not recommended for government or sensitive commercial workloads. 

Since 2016, Mattermost has partnered with GitLab to include Team Edition in the GitLab Omnibus package. Originally designed for teams of 25–50 users, it included GitLab SSO and DevSecOps integrations. Over time, Team Edition was widely over-deployed, sometimes to thousands of users, leading to performance issues and confusion between free and commercial offerings. Additionally, GitLab SSO was used as a gateway to other identity providers, overlapping with SSO capabilities reserved for paid Enterprise editions. 

In 2025, GitLab began evaluating the removal of Mattermost from the Omnibus package to reduce its size. This prompted both companies to redefine their shared offering. As part of this transition, SSO is being removed from the Team Edition, aligning it with its intended scope for small teams and hobbyist use. Advanced access controls features will continue to be available in the commercial editions, including Mattermost Entry (free).  Gitlab Omnibus will ship with the v10.11 ESR, enabling continued use of Gitlab SSO until a redefinition of the partnership is determined. Please see more details in `this forum post <https://forum.mattermost.com/t/mattermost-v11-changes-in-free-offerings/25126>`_.

Mattermost, Inc. offers its software under different licenses, including open source. An open source “community edition” of the offering is compiled from the `Mattermost open source project <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost>`_ under a reciprocal open source license agreement, and in accordance with the `Mattermost trademark policy <https://mattermost.com/trademark-standards-of-use>`_, which requires Mattermost wordmark and trademark be replaced, unless in some circumstances special permission is extended.  The purpose of the reciprocal open source license, known as AGPLv3 or “GNU Affero General Public License”, is to have the benefits of open source reach the broader community. Community members creating derivative works of the open source code base are required to use the same reciprocal open source license, AGPLv3, to downstream beneficiaries.  

Organizations who prefer not to use a reciprocal open source license can choose to use one of the Enterprise Edition offerings under a commercial license.
