UI & ADA Roadmap

How to Use This Roadmap
-----------------------

To see what UI and ADA changes occurred between versions:

1. Find your current Mattermost version in the **Version** column
2. Look at all entries for versions above your current version to see what changes will be included in your upgrade
3. Review both **UI** and **ADA** categories to understand the full scope of interface and accessibility improvements

Updating This Roadmap
---------------------

When releasing a new version:

1. Add a new row to the table above for each UI or ADA change
2. Use the **Version** column for the release version (e.g., v2.5, v3.0)
3. Set **Category** to either "UI" for interface changes or "ADA" for accessibility improvements
4. Provide a brief but descriptive **Change Description**
5. Include the **Internal Ticket #** for tracking and reference purposes
