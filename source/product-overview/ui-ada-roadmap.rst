Updating This Roadmap
---------------------

When releasing a new version with UI or ADA changes:

1. Add a new row to the table above
2. Use the version number in the first column
3. Specify either "UI" or "ADA" in the Category column
4. Provide a clear, concise description of the change
5. Include the internal ticket number for reference

This manual approach ensures that administrators have immediate access to rolled-up UI and accessibility changes without needing to parse through detailed release notes.
