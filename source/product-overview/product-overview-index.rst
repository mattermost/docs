The Intelligent Mission Environment (IME)
------------------------------------------

Mattermost is an Intelligent Mission Environment (IME), purpose-built for mission-critical operations. It delivers a unified platform for secure, extensible, AI-powered collaboration and automation, deployable across the most demanding environments—from classified networks to the tactical edge. Organizations use Mattermost to maintain full control over communications, workflows, and infrastructure while accelerating decision-making.

IME integrates secure messaging, workflow automation, task management, agentic AI, and real-time communication within a sovereign, cyber-resilient architecture. It supports extensibility through open APIs and integrations, and runs flexibly across on-premises, cloud, and air-gapped systems—enabling operational focus, adaptability, and resilience from edge nodes to centralized data centers.
