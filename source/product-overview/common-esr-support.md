- Support for Mattermost Server v10.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) has come to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2025. Upgrading to [Mattermost Server v10.11](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/mattermost-v10-changelog.html#release-v10-11-extended-support-release) or later is required.
- All Mattermost users must accept Mattermost's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://mattermost.com/terms-of-use/#acceptable-use-policy) and [Privacy Policy](https://mattermost.com/privacy-policy/) when creating an account or accessing Mattermost. For customers with a Mattermost subscription, including self-hosted deployments, organizations may replace or override the Acceptable Use Policy in the [Mattermost System Console](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings.html#terms-of-use-link) with their own acceptable use or conduct policies, based on contractual terms with Mattermost, so long as your own terms either incorporate the Acceptable Use Policy or include equivalent terms. If you change the default link to add your own terms for using the service you provide, your new terms must include a link to the default terms so end users are aware of the Mattermost Acceptable Use Policy for Mattermost software.
