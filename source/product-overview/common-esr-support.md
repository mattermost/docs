- Support for Mattermost Server v10.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) has come to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2025. Upgrading to [Mattermost Server v10.11](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/mattermost-v10-changelog.html#release-v10-11-extended-support-release) or later is required.
- All Mattermost users must accept Mattermost's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://mattermost.com/terms-of-use/#acceptable-use-policy) and [Privacy Policy](https://mattermost.com/privacy-policy/) when creating an account or accessing Mattermost. For self-hosted deployments, system admins may override the default Acceptable Use Policy with their own acceptable use policy, as long as it links back to Mattermost’s policy. See the [End User Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/end-user-guide/access/acceptable-use-and-privacy-policy) documentation for details.
