- Support for Mattermost Server v10.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) is coming to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2025. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v10.11 or later is recommended.
- Upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` -> ``major_next``) is fully supported and tested. However, upgrading from ESR-to-ESR (``major`` to ``major+2``) is supported, but not tested. If you plan to upgrade across multiple releases, we strongly recommend upgrading from an ESR to another ESR. For example, if you're upgrading from the v8.1 ESR, upgrade to the [v9.5 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/mattermost-v9-changelog.html#release-v9-5-extended-support-release) or the [v9.11 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/mattermost-v9-changelog.html#release-v9-11-extended-support-release).
- See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) documentation for details on upgrading to a newer release.
- See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for details about the upcoming release.
