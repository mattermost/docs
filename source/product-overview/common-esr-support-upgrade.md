- Support for Mattermost Server v10.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) is coming to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2025. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v10.11 or later is recommended.
- Upgrading from one Extended Support Release (ESR) to the next ESR (``major`` -> ``major_next``) is fully supported and tested. However, upgrading across multiple ESR versions (``major`` to ``major+2``) is supported, but not tested. If you plan to skip versions, we strongly recommend upgrading only between ESR releases. For example, if you're upgrading from the v8.1 ESR, upgrade to the [v10.11 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/mattermost-v10-changelog.html#release-v10-11-extended-support-release). Please refer to [the Extended Support Release documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) for details on supported ESR versions.
- See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) documentation for details on upgrading to a newer release.
- See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for details about the upcoming release.
