- Support for Mattermost Server v10.5 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/release-policy.html#extended-support-releases) has come to the end of its life cycle on November 15, 2025. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v10.11 or later is required.
- Upgrading from one Extended Support Release (ESR) to the next ESR (``major`` -> ``major_next``) is fully supported and tested. However, upgrading across multiple ESR versions (``major`` to ``major+2``) is supported, but not tested. If you plan to skip versions, we strongly recommend upgrading only between ESR releases. For example, if you're upgrading from v8.1 ESR, upgrade to the v9.5 ESR or the v9.11 ESR before attempting to upgrade to the [v10.5 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/mattermost-v10-changelog.html#release-v10-5-extended-support-release) or the [v10.11 ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/mattermost-v10-changelog.html#release-v10-11-extended-support-release).
- See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) documentation for details on upgrading to a newer release.
- See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for details about the upcoming release.
