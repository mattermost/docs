"**Markdown**: Mattermost supports the use of `Markdown. "

"integrations."

"**Hashtags**: Use hashtags to make your Zapier posts searchable. Use "
"different hashtags for different services and Zapier integrations. For "
"example, use the dynamic fields available in Zapier to include ticket a "
"JIRA ticket number in hashtags. This makes all conversation on a specific"
" ticket instantly searchable by clicking the hashtag."

"**Quick Links**: Link back to the service that fired the zap through the "
"use of Markdown `embedded links "
"<https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-"
