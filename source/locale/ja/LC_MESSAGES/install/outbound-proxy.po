"In some scenarios, you may wish to use Mattermost behind a proxy. This "
"can be used to do things such as monitoring outbound traffic from "
"Mattermost or controlling which websites can appear in link previews and "
"other embedded content."

"Mattermost's use of a proxy is configured using the ``HTTP_PROXY``, "
"``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY`` environment variables."

"The ``HTTP_PROXY`` and ``HTTPS_PROXY`` environment variables store the "
"address of the proxy server for HTTP and HTTPS requests respectively. "
"This value should include the protocol and port of the proxy such as "
"``http://192.168.4.5:3128``."

msgid ""
"If you wish to have Mattermost authenticate with your proxy, it supports "
"HTTP basic authentication by specifying the address of the proxy such as "
"``http://mattermost:password@192.168.4.5:3128``."

"Note that when proxying HTTPS resources, you will need to configure your "
"Mattermost server with the root certificate of the proxy. Otherwise, "
"Mattermost will refuse any response from the proxy as it will detect that"
" its connection has been intercepted."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install/outbound-proxy.rst:25
msgid ""
"The ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable can be set to prevent certain "
"requests from going through the proxy, such as to an SSO provider (such "
"as GitLab or SAML) or to intranet sites that should be accessible in link"
" previews. It can be configured as a set of comma-separted IP addresses "
"(e.g. 1.2.3.4), IP address ranges specified in CIDR notation (e.g. "
"1.2.3.4/8), or domain names. An IP address or domain name can also "
"include a port number."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install/outbound-proxy.rst:27
msgid ""
"When specifying a domain name, that domain name also matches its sub "
"domains as well. A domain name with a leading ``.`` matches only sub "
"domains. For example, ``example.com`` matches both ``example.com`` as "
"well as ``sub.example.com`` while ``.example.com`` only matches the "
"latter."
