"Before running the bulk loading command, you must first create a `JSONL "
"<http://jsonlines.org>`__ file that contains the data that you want to "
"import. After you create the file, run the bulk load command in "
"validation mode. In this mode, the data is checked for correctness, but "
"is not written to the database. After validating, run the command in "
"apply mode, which saves the data to the database."
