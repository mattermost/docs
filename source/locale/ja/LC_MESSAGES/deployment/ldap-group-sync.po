"The groups feature is useful for organizations that have many new users "
"to onboard or that onboard users frequently and want to ensure users are "
"added to default teams and channels that are pertinent to them. The group"
" feature currently supports creating groups by synchronization with your "
"AD/LDAP system groups. AD/LDAP nested groups are also supported. Please "
"see `this forum post <https://forum.mattermost.org/t/ldap-group-sync-"
"alpha-release/6351>`__ for more details. For a technical overview of the "
