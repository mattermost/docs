"Alternatively, you can use an Id Attribute instead of email to bind the "
"user.  We recommend choosing an ID that is unique and will not change "

"Configuring with an Id Attribute allows you to reuse an email address for"
" a new user without the old user's information being exposed. For "
"instance, if a user with an email address joe.smith@mattermost.com was "
"once an employee, a new employee named Joe Smith can use the same email. "
"This configuration is also useful when a user's name changes and their "
"email needs to be updated."
