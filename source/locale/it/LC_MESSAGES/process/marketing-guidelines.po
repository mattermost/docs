"**Magnetic to IT.** We need headlines and openings that draw in IT "
"audiences (these include Linux admins, security experts, directors of "

"**Have something to say**. Always ask yourself, what am I trying to "
"communicate? When you have nothing of value to say, you will end up "
"writing sentences that may sound meaningful but deliver nothing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:57
msgid ""
"**Think from the reader's perspective**. Then ask yourself, \"What's in "
"it for me [the reader]?\" For example, you might be proud to announce an "
"exciting new product feature, but unless you can quickly and concisely "
"describe the benefit to the reader, the reader will lose interest. "
"However, do not go to the other extreme and overstate benefits. That will"
" also drive away the reader."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:58
msgid ""
"**Be specific**. Use concrete examples. Don't take things for granted. "
"Explain terms that the reader may be unfamiliar with. For example, do not"
" write \"data sovereignty\" without explaining the term (e.g. \"data "
"sovereignty means the ability to control the country in which your data "
"is stored and the laws under which it may be legally accessed\")."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:59
msgid ""
"**Choose simple words**. Write use rather than utilize or leverage, help "
"rather than facilitate, improve rather than ameliorate, imperfect rather "
"than sub-optimal. It is true that in technical and business writing you "
"sometimes need to choose words that are not in everyday usage, in order "
"to communicate with precision and clarity. An example is the word "
"\"compliance\". However, if you use long or technical words "
"unnecessarily, inappropriately or out of context you will only cloud your"
" meaning. You would not, for example, say something like \"my driving is "
"fully in compliance with current traffic regulations\". Instead, you'd "
"use an everyday term like \"I observe the rules of the road\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:60
msgid ""
"**Write short sentences**. Ideally, each sentence should contain one "
"thought. More than one creates complexity and causes confusion. Reread "
"each sentence and remove words that are unnecessary. These include "
"\"fluff\" words like very, little and rather. If something is important, "
"there is no need to add the word \"very\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:61
msgid ""
"**Write short paragraphs**. In academic writing, each paragraph develops "
"one idea and often includes many sentences. But in casual, everyday "
"writing, the style is less formal and paragraphs may be as short as a "
"single sentence (or even a single word). Look at newspaper articles: "
"journalists write short sentences because this makes information easy to "
"digest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:62
msgid ""
"**Use the active voice**. As a simple example: Mattermost improves your "
"workplace productivity sounds far better than Your workplace productivity"
" is improved by Mattermost. The active voice is direct and concrete. The "
"passive voice tends to lead you into obscure and abstract thinking."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:63
msgid ""
"**Don't ramble or overwrite**. Remind yourself what you set out to "
"communicate (Point 1). Do not lose your focus. Keep the text as long as "
"necessary, but as short as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:64
msgid ""
"**Avoid cliché openers**. By that we mean opening sentences that the "
"audience has read a million times before, such as, \"In an increasingly "
"competitive business environment…\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:65
msgid ""
"**Edit ruthlessly**. Use the first draft to get your thoughts together. "
"Then leave it for a few hours (or even days). Shorten, delete, and "
"rewrite anything that does not add to the meaning. Run a spelling and "
"grammar check."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:66
msgid ""
"**Ask a colleague**. Still not 100% happy? A colleague should review the "
"text and tell you if anything is unclear or if you could express yourself"
" better. They might offer some useful fresh insights."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/marketing-guidelines.rst:67
msgid ""
"**Now, relax**. If you are in the wrong frame of mind you will either get"
" writer's block or your writing will be stiff and unnatural. Take your "
"time. Remove any distractions. Keep things simple."

"**Write so an international audience can understand you**. Avoid "

"**Try to avoid putting anything in a negative light**. Be an optimist. "

"“performance improvements”."

"**Post during the workday when possible**. The best time to post to "
"Twitter during the workweek is between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. local time. (The"
