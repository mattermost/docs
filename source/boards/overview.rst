Mattermost Boards provides tight integration between project management and Mattermost to align, define, organize, track, and manage work across teams, and is part of all Mattermost editions.

With Boards you can:

* **Manage projects and organize tasks:** A familiar kanban board structure integrated with channel-based communication.
* **Manage and collaborate on various projects:** Software releases, product launches, meetings, personal to-do’s, events, etc.
* **Stay on schedule:** Clearly-defined tasks, owners, checklists, and deadlines
* **Increase transparency and keep everybody in the loop:** Everything your team needs in one place, including documents, images, and links that are visible to every stakeholder

Boards is also available as a separate single-user Personal Edition called Focalboard.

What's a board?
---------------

A board is a collection of cards to help you manage your projects, organize tasks, and collaborate with your team all in one place.

Boards are a collaborative tool, and each board belongs to the team in which it’s created. Only members of that team can be assigned to roles on that board.

What's a card?
--------------

Cards are used on a board to track individual work items. Cards are customizable and can have a number of properties added to them, which are then used as a way to tag, sort, and filter the cards.

When working with cards, you can manage properties, add descriptions, attach images, assign them to team members, mention team members, add comments, and so on.

Access your boards
------------------

Mattermost Boards is accessible from the Product menu in the top left corner of Mattermost. If you’re using Mattermost 6.0 or later, select the Product menu in the top left corner of Mattermost to open Boards. If you’re on the Mattermost Desktop app, you can also quickly access Boards from a tab at the top of Mattermost called Boards.

Link a board to a channel
-------------------------

From Mattermost Boards v7.2, boards can be linked to channels and accessed from the channel Apps Bar. Clicking on the Boards icon from the Apps Bar in a channel will open a right-hand sidebar (RHS) where channel members can search for and link boards to the channel.

To link a board to the channel, click on the `Add` button to open the link boards dialog and search for a board to link. Channel members can only search and link boards within the team where they are also board admins.

Note:
A channel can be linked to multiple boards, but each individual board can only be linked to one channel at a time. Linking the same board to another channel will automatically remove the link from the previous channel.

New boards can also be created from the Boards Apps Bar by clicking on the `Create a Board` button, which will automatically link the new board to the current channel.

After a board is linked to a channel, it will appear on the RHS of the Boards Apps Bar. Linking a board to a channel automatically grants all channel members access to the board. Select a linked board to navigate directly to the board.

Note: For users upgrading to Mattermost Boards v7.2 or later
To maintain the same organization, all the boards previously associated with the workspace will automatically appear on the RHS post-migration.

Unlink a board from a channel
-----------------------------

Board admins can unlink their board from a channel by clicking on the Boards Apps Bar within a channel and clicking on the options menu (...) to select the unlink option.

Alternatively, the board admin can open the Share dialog on their board, and select the unlink option from the role drop down menu next to the channel’s name.
