Mattermost Boards provides tight integration between project management and Mattermost to align, define, organize, track, and manage work across teams, and is part of all Mattermost editions.

With Boards you can:

* **Manage projects and organize tasks:** A familiar kanban board structure integrated with channel-based communication.
* **Manage and collaborate on various projects:** Software releases, product launches, meetings, personal to-doâ€™s, events, etc.
* **Stay on schedule:** Clearly-defined tasks, owners, checklists, and deadlines
* **Increase transparency and keep everybody in the loop:** Everything your team needs in one place, including documents, images, and links that are visible to every stakeholder

Boards is also available as a separate single-user Personal Edition called Focalboard.
