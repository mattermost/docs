Templates
=========

Templates provide you with a predefined structure so that you can get started quickly.

Board templates 
---------------

Board templates include:

* Meeting Notes
* Personal Goals
* Project Tasks
* Roadmap
* Empty Board

If none of those boards fit your use case, you can use a blank template and customize it as needed. To create a board template select **+ Add Board**, then select **+ New template**. To turn an existing board into a template, hover over the board title in the sidebar. Select the options menu **(…)**, then select **New template from board**.

Card templates
---------------

Each board can have a set of card templates. To create a new card template, click on the dropdown by the “New” button and select “+ New template”.

A card editor opens with a banner indicating this is a template. You can new create new cards using this new template.

Alternatively, you can turn any card into a template:

1. Open the card editor
2. Click on the options menu (… at the top right)
3. Select “New template from card”
