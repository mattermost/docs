Import your data
================

You can import data from other tools to use with Boards. `Contribute code <https://mattermost.github.io/focalboard/>`_ to expand this.

Import from Asana
-----------------

This node app converts an Asana JSON archive into a ``.boardarchive`` file.

1. Log into your Asana account.
2. Select the drop-down menu next to the Asana board's name. Then select **Export/Print > JSON**. This will create an archive file which you'll use in Boards.
3. Save the file locally, e.g. to ``asana.json``.
4. Open a terminal window on your local machine and navigate to ``focalboard/webapp``.
5. Run ``npm install``.
6. Change directory to ``focalboard/import/asana``.
7. Run ``npm install``.
8. From within the same folder, run ``npx ts-node importAsana.ts -i <asana.json> -o archive.boardarchive``. This generates the following data:

.. code-block::
   
    My-MacbookPro:asana macbook$ npx ts-node importAsana.ts -i ~/Downloads/asana.json -o archive.boardarchive
    Board: 1:1 Meeting Agenda Test
