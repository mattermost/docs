Working with Boards
===================

Using Boards begins with selecting the type of board you want to use. The containers within a board, called cards, are used for tasks. Views are a way to group cards based on their property (e.g., priority, status, etc).

To add a new board, select **+ Add Board** in the bottom left corner of the screen.

Changing Views
--------------

For this exercise, select the **Project Tasks** template. The first view of the new board is a table of all tasks.

* Select **By Status** in the sidebar to see a board view.
* Select **Properties** and enable **Priority** and **Date created** to add those properties to the card display.
* You can also change the **Group By**, **Filter**, and **Sort** settings of the view.

All changes you make are saved immediately.

Renaming Boards
---------------

Click on the board title to edit it. You can also set an icon on boards and cards.

Editing cards 
-------------

Select a card to edit it. A card consists of:

* **A set of properties:** Properties are common to all cards in a board. Board views can group cards by “Select” type properties into different columns.
* **A list of comments:** Comments are useful for noting important changes or milestones.
* **A set of content:** The content of a card can consist of markdown text and images. Use this to record detailed specs or design decisions for an item for example.

Press ESC or select **X** on the top left corner of a card to close it.

Dragging cards 
--------------

Drag cards from one column to another to change their group-by property. For example, drag a card to the **Completed** column to mark it as completed. When a board is unsorted, you can drag a card to a specific row in a column.

For sorted boards, dragging a card to a column will auto-sort it using the specified sort settings.

Adding New Views 
----------------

Select the dropdown next to the view name, and then select **Add view** to add a new view.

Table Views 
-----------

Each column corresponds to a card property. You can edit cells directly or you can select **Open** to open the card editor for that row.

Select the headers to sort them or insert new properties.
