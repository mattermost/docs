Working with Boards
===================

Using Boards begins with selecting the type of board you want to use. The containers within a board, called cards, are used for tasks. Views are a way to group cards based on their property (e.g., priority, status, etc).

Adding new Boards
-----------------

1. Click “+ Add Board” at the lower left of the sidebar to add a new board to Focalboard.
2. Pick “Project Tasks” from the list of templates.
3. This shows the first view of the new board, which is a table of all tasks 
4. Click on “By Status” in the sidebar to see a board view 
5. Click on the properties menu, and turn on “Priority” and “Date created”. This will add those properties to the card display. 

You can likewise change the “Group By”, “Filter”, and “Sort” settings of the view. In general, all changes you make are saved immediately

Click on a card to edit it. A card consists of:

- A set of properties: Properties are common to all cards in a board. Board views can group cards by “Select” type properties into different columns.
- A list of comments: Comments are useful for noting important changes or milestones.
- A set of content: The content of a card can consist of markdown text and images. Use this to record detailed specs or design decisions for an item for example.

Press ESC or click outside the card editor dialog to close the card editor.

Dragging cards 
--------------

Drag cards from one column to another to change their group-by property. For example, drag a card to the “Completed” column to mark it as completed. When a board is unsorted, you can drag a card to a specific row in a column.

For sorted boards, dragging a card to a column with auto-sort it using the specified sort settings.

Adding new Views 
----------------

Select the dropdown next to the view name, and then select **Add view** to add a new view.

Table Views

Each column corresponds to a card property. Cells can be edited directly, or you can open the card editor for a row by hovering over the title and clicking “open”.

Select the headers to sort them or insert new properties.
