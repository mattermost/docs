View, sort, and filter
======================

There are a number of ways you can visualize your boards and cards. The type of template you choose provides a set of view options.

You can organize cards and narrow your focus on key work items with our filter, sort, and grouping options. From the board header, you can quickly toggle on different properties to display, change the card grouping, apply filters, and adjust how the cards are sorted.

You can filter by multiple properties as well as multiple values within the same property. When filtering by multiple properties, **all conditions** that you've selected need to be true in order for the filtered results to display. For example, if you want to filter your view to only display cards associated with a **Status** of **Not Started** and a **Priority** of **High**, you would add both of them to that filter.

.. note:: 
   Groups and filters currently only support the `SELECT` property type.

When filtering by multiple values within the same property, **any condition** that you've selected can be true for the filtered results to display. For example, if you filter your view by **Priority** values of **High** and **Medium**, your board will display any cards with either of those property values.

Additionally, you can adjust whether you want to include or exclude specific values within a property, or only display properties with empty or populated results.

Lastly, you can combine views with filters to create unique display options without having to constantly reapply filters. Each view retains all the applied filters, groups, and sort options, allowing you to create multiple views with unique filters. For example, you can create a **By milestone** view under a board, and use a filter to only display items for specific milestones.
