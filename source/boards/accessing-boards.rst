Accessing your Boards
=====================

Boards currently uses channel-based permissions, meaning that only members of the associated channel can access (read/write) the boards for that channel.

You can use this to create private boards:

1. Create or join a Private channel, Group Message, or Direct Message.
2. Select the **Boards** icon in the channel header.
3. Create a board.

Select the Boards icon in the channel header or App Switcher to open the Boards workspace for the current channel, Direct Message, or Group Message - which can only be accessed by members of the channel or message. 

You can share a read-only version of any board with anyone who has the link.
