Boards uses channel-based permissions, meaning that all members of the associated channel can access (read/write) the boards for that channel.

To create private boards: 

1. Create or join a private channel, group message, or direct message.
2. Select the **Boards** icon in the channel header.
3. Create a board.

You can share a read-only version of any board with anyone who has the link.
