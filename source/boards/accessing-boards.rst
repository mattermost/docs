Accessing your Boards
=====================

Focalboard currently uses channel-based permissions, meaning that only members of the associated channel can access (read/write) the boards for that channel.

You can use this to create private boards:

1. Create or join a Private channel, Group Message, or Direct Message.
2. Select the **Boards** icon in the channel header.
3. Create a board.

Only members of channel you created/joined can access the board. However, you can share a read-only version of any board with anyone (including unauthenticated users) who has the generated link.
