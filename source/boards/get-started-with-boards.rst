Boards are used for planning projects collaboratively. You can access the list of channels and their boards from the drop-down menu in the left-hand sidebar. Boards are made up of cards, and cards can have a wide range of purposes.

See our `Mattermost boards </guides/boards.html>`__ documentation for details on the many ways you can use Boards to enable team collaboration.

Create a board
--------------

When you first start using boards, you need to create a board. You can select a template from the options provided or you can create an empty board. The only difference is that a template will be populated with sample cards, properties, and views, and in an empty template you start from scratch.

To find a board, open boards and select the drop-down menu in the sidebar. You can search for a workspace or browse through all existing workspaces. Each workspace is linked to the channel it was created in. This includes direct messages and group messages.

See the `working with boards </boards/working-with-boards.html>`_ and `templates </boards/templates.html>`_ documentation for more information.

Create a card
-------------

Cards are like sticky notes. You can arrange them in various ways, using different views. You can also give them multiple areas of information called properties. Adding and using properties makes it easier to organize and find cards using filters based on card properties.

Once you've chosen a board template, you'll find pre-populated cards. You can use and edit those, or create new ones. Use the **Description** field to add details, and you can use Markdown to add formatting. You can add comments to a card in the **Comments** section.

Select an existing card to open it or create a new card.

See the `work with cards documentation </boards/work-with-cards.html>`_ for more information about working with cards.

Description
-----------

Use the description to provide context around the reason for the card. Cards are visible to anyone who can access the board, so if there's sensitive information it's best not to include it here. You can add links to external documentation, as well as at-mention teammates.

Comments
--------

Comments are a helpful way to provide feedback or ask questions related to a card, and comments are time and date stamped so they're easy to track. Comments are listed in descending order from most recent to oldest.

To add a comment, select the **Comment** field. When you're finished, select **Save**.

Properties
----------

You can create properties for your cards that suit the way you're using them. If you're planning a project, you might want to have properties such as **Due date**, **Assigned to**, and **Priority**. Properties are displayed on the card when you open it, and you can also choose to display your cards based on their properties, using filters.

Properties can be renamed and deleted.

See the `properties </boards/work-with-cards.html#add-and-manage-properties>`_ documentation for more information.

Views
-----

View are a great way to assess your board from various angles and allow your team to visualize the same cards and data from different perspectives, so they can stay up-to-date in the way that works best for them. Some views are linear, while others are closer to Kanban style. Views with a more linear display, such as the table view, display less context but are easier to scroll through. 

To add a new view, go to **Add a new view** from the view drop-down, then select from any of the following views:

- **Board**: Adds a Kanban board that allows your team to organize cards in swim lanes grouped by any property of your choosing. This view helps you visualize your project progress.
- **Table**: Displays cards in a table format with rows and columns. Use this view to get an overview of all your project tasks. Easily view and compare the state of all properties across all cards without needing to open individual cards.
- **Gallery**: Displays cards in a gallery format, so you can manage and organize cards with image attachments.
- **Calendar**: Adds a calendar view to easily visualize your cards by dates and keep track of deadlines.

See the `work with views </boards/working-with-boards.html#changing-views>`__ documentation for more information.

Filters and sorting
-------------------

You can organize and find the cards you're looking for with our filter, sort, and grouping options. From the Board header, you can quickly toggle on different properties, change the group display, set filters, and change how the cards are sorted. Combine views with filters to make unique boards for specific items. For example, you can create a **By milestone** board and then use a filter to only display items for specific milestones.

Share
-----

Once you've created a board and cards, you can generate a link which can be shared publicly or within only your team. To share a board, select **Share** at the top right of the Board view. Copy the link to share the board internally with your team or generate public link that can be accessed by anyone externally.
