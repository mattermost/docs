Work with Cards
===============

Cards can have different configuration fields, depending on the type of board you've selected. For example, in a Roadmap board you'll find the cards include an option for **Type** where you can add categories such as Bug, Triage, etc. A Task board doesn't include a Type field, but includes **Status** and **Priority**. All cards have a **New Property** field. For this field, you can select the type from the drop-down menu. It'll then be added to your card.

The default name for a new property is **New Property**. Ensure that you name your property as it's added to the filter list at the top of the board and having all your filters named **New Property** makes it difficult to work out what you're filtering. You can rename a property field by opening up a card and selecting **New Property**. Enter the new name in the field provided. The change is saved immediately and applied across all cards.
