Desktop app troubleshooting
============================

Broken shortcuts after upgrading to v6.1.0 (Windows MSI only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After upgrading to Mattermost Desktop v6.1.0 using the Windows MSI installer from an older release, the desktop or taskbar shortcut shows the wrong icon or fails to launch. This is due to a one-time icon handling change in the Windows MSI installer to improve shortcut reliability for future upgrades. 

This issue doesn't block app usage and only affects Windows MSI installer upgrades from pre-v6.1.0 versions. Users can launch Mattermost from the Start Menu or a working desktop shortcut.Future upgrades to v6.1.1 and later will not require shortcut recreation.

To resolve this issue, recreate the shortcut:

1. Right-click the broken shortcut on the taskbar and select **Unpin from taskbar**.
2. Launch Mattermost Desktop from the Start Menu or a working desktop shortcut.
3. Right-click the Mattermost icon in the taskbar while the application is running.
4. Select **Pin to taskbar**.

The new shortcut will work correctly for all future upgrades.

Organizations standardizing on Windows installations can choose between Windows Store (recommended for automatic updates) or MSI packages (traditional deployment). The MSI method includes this one-time shortcut adjustment; the Windows Store method doesn't.

Where is configuration stored locally?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The location of the Mattermost desktop app configuration file depends on the platform where you're running Mattermost (and, in the case of macOS, how you've chosen to install the app):

- Windows: ``Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Mattermost``
- macOS installer: ``/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Mattermost``
- macOS App Store: ``/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/Mattermost.Desktop/Data/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` (via Finder: ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` as the extension is hidden)
- Linux: ``~/.config/Mattermost``

.. note::

  - Local configuration data is not automatically removed when uninstalling the desktop app. If you wish to remove all data, you must manually remove the files from the applicable location noted above.
  - Prior to uninstalling, you can choose to log out of any active sessions. You can terminate active sessions from another Mattermost session in **Profile > Security > View and Logout of Active Sessions**, then select **Log Out**. Desktop app sessions are labeled as **Native Desktop App**.

Update notifications not appearing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're not seeing in-app update notifications when new versions are available:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure outbound HTTPS communication to ``mattermost.com`` is allowed.

2. **Manually check for updates**: Go to **Help > Check for Updates** or **Settings > General > Check for Updates Now** to trigger an immediate check.

3. **Verify update notifications are enabled**:

   - On Windows: Go to **… > File > Settings** and ensure **Automatically check for updates** is enabled.
   - On macOS: Go to **Mattermost > Settings** and ensure **Automatically check for updates** is enabled.

4. **Check Group Policy settings** (Enterprise deployments): Your system administrator may have disabled update notifications via the ``EnableAutoUpdates`` Group Policy. Contact your IT department for clarification.

5. **Version previously skipped**: If you selected **Skip This Version** for the current release, manually check for updates to see it again.

Deep links open in the wrong workspace in multi-view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you experience deep links opening in the wrong workspace, ensure all relevant workspaces are pre-provisioned via the Group Policy ``DefaultServerList``. See the :ref:`multi-view and group policies <deployment-guide/desktop/desktop-msi-installer-and-group-policy-install:multi-view and Group Policies>` documentation for details.

- Verify that workspace URLs match exactly (including protocol and subdomain) so links route to the intended workspace.
- Edit the workspace list to correct or remove stale entries, then retry the link.

High CPU or memory when multiple workspaces open
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify the device is powerful enough to run several workspaces concurrently. Close unused tabs and pop-out windows to reduce load.

Check the :doc:`desktop app advanced settings </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-desktop-app-experience>`. Toggle **Use GPU hardware acceleration** off on systems with unstable drivers.

Desktop App displays white screen while launching and doesn't load the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Delete the local ``Mattermost desktop app`` configuration file. See the `Where is configuration stored locally? <#where-is-configuration-stored-locally>`__ section above for file location details.
2. Reinstall the application. 

.. _upgrade-to-v6-1-0-fails-or-installs-duplicate-version-windows-msi:

Upgrade to v6.1.0 fails or installs duplicate version (Windows MSI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing v6.1.0 MSI, the old version still appears, both versions are present, or the upgrade doesn't seem to work. This is because you had a per-user installation from v5.9 to v6.0.4. From v6.1.0, the MSI installer defaults to per-machine (system-wide) installation. MSI installers cannot automatically upgrade across different installation contexts (per-user to per-machine).

To check your installation type before upgrading, open File Explorer.

- If Mattermost is in ``C:\Program Files\Mattermost`` or ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Mattermost``: Per-machine install (upgrade will work normally)
- If Mattermost is in ``C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\...``: Per-user install (requires manual uninstall before v6.1.0)

To resolve this issue, you must manually uninstall the old version before installing v6.1.0:

1. Uninstall both versions:

   - Go to **Settings > Apps** or **Control Panel > Programs and Features**.
   - Uninstall all Mattermost Desktop entries.

2. Download the v6.1.0 MSI installer again from the `releases page <https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases>`__.
3. Install v6.1.0 with administrator privileges (it will install to ``C:\Program Files\Mattermost``).
4. Future upgrades will work normally.

"Installation has failed" dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The app data might be corrupted. Remove all the files in ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\mattermost``, then try reinstalling the app.
    
"The application "Mattermost" can't be opened" dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On macOS Catalina, this dialog can be triggered if the Mac Archive Utility is the default method for decompressing files. In this case using a third-party tool such as `Keka <https://www.keka.io>`_ or `Unarchiver <https://macpaw.com/the-unarchiver>`_ may resolve the problem.

Desktop App window is black and doesn't load the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ensure you have installed the latest desktop app version available.
2. Clear your cache and reload the app from **View > Clear Cache and Reload** or press :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`R` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⌘` :kbd:`⇧` :kbd:`R` on Mac.
3. Quit the app and restart it to see if the issue clears.
4. Disable GPU hardware acceleration.

  - On Windows or Linux, select **File > Settings** and clear the **Use GPU hardware acceleration** option.
  - On macOS, select **Mattermost > Settings** and clear the **Use GPU hardware acceleration** option.

5. If you are using a special video driver, such as Optimus, try disabling it to see if the problem is resolved.

Desktop App window is white and doesn't load the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ensure you have installed the latest desktop app version available.
2. Delete the ``%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Mattermost`` directory on your local machine.
3. Reinstall the desktop app.

Desktop App is not visible, but the Mattermost icon is in the Task Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur on Windows in a multiple-monitor setup. When you disconnect the monitor that Mattermost is displayed on, Mattermost continues to display at screen coordinates that no longer exist.

To resolve this issue, you can reset the desktop app screen location by deleting the screen location file. When the file is not present, the desktop app displays on the primary monitor by default.

To reset the desktop app screen location:

1. If the desktop app is running, right-click the Mattermost icon in the task bar, then select **Close Window**.
2. Open Windows File Explorer, and go to the ``%APPDATA%\Mattermost`` folder.
3. Delete the file ``bounds-info.json``.

Desktop App constantly refreshes the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur when ``localStorage`` has an unexpected state. To resolve the issue:

- Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, go to the ``%APPDATA%\Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
- Mac: Open Finder, go to the ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
- Linux: Open the File Manager, go to the ``~/.config/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder. Linux file managers may hide folders starting with a period by default. You can delete them from the terminal using ``rm -rf ~/.config/Mattermost``.
      
Desktop App constantly asks to log in to Mattermost server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur after a crash or unexpected shutdown of the desktop app that causes the app data to be corrupted. To resolve the issue:

- Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, go to the ``%APPDATA%\Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.
- Mac: Open Finder, go to the ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.
- Linux: Open the file manager, go to the ``~/.config/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files. Linux file managers may hide folders starting with a period by default. You can delete them from the terminal using ``rm -rf ~/.config/Mattermost``.

"Internal error: BrowserWindow 'unresponsive' event has been emitted"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selecting **Show Details** on the dialog provides logs. Ways to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the cache via **View > Clear Cache and Reload** or press :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`R` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⌘` :kbd:`⇧` :kbd:`R` on Mac.
2. Go to App Settings via **File > Settings** (or by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`,` on Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`⌘` :kbd:`,` on Mac) and unselect hardware acceleration.
  
Desktop app not responsive within Citrix Virtual Apps or Desktop Environment
