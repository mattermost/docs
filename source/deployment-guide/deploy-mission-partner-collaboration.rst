Deploy for Mission Partner Collaboration
=======================================

This reference architecture demonstrates how to deploy Mattermost to enable secure collaboration between multiple organizations or mission partners while maintaining information sharing controls and security boundaries.

Overview
--------

Mission Partner Collaboration deployment enables multiple allied networks to collaborate through Mattermost while maintaining network isolation and controlled information sharing. This architecture supports scenarios where different organizations need to collaborate on shared objectives while maintaining their own security boundaries and data sovereignty.

Architecture Components
----------------------

The Mission Partner Collaboration architecture consists of:

**Allied Network A**
  - Mattermost Clients with proxy server authentication
  - Self-hosted Large Language Model (LLM) integration
  - S3-compatible object storage for file management
  - PostgreSQL database for data persistence
  - Optional calls recording instance
  - Mattermost server with full collaboration features

**Coalition Partner Network B**
  - Mirror configuration of Allied Network A
  - Independent Mattermost server deployment
  - Separate authentication and storage systems
  - Bilateral communication capabilities with Network A

**Shared Infrastructure**
  - Guest account management for cross-network access
  - Shared channels using HTTPS/VPN connectivity
  - Matrix & XMPP interoperability for external communication
  - Centralized authentication and access control

**Enterprise Networks C & D**
  - Microsoft 365 integration (Teams + Outlook)
  - Mattermost server integration for sovereign collaboration
  - Connection to shared infrastructure via guest accounts
  - Cloud connectivity to M365 and Azure OpenAI services

Key Features
-----------

**Secure Multi-Network Communication**
  - Isolated network deployment with controlled interconnection
  - Guest account system for cross-organizational access
  - Encrypted communication channels between networks
  - Role-based access controls for shared resources

**Information Sharing Controls**
  - Granular permissions for shared channels and content
  - Data classification and handling policies
  - Audit trails and compliance reporting
  - Configurable information barriers between organizations

**Integrated Collaboration Tools**
  - Messaging and file sharing across organizational boundaries
  - Workflow automation for cross-organizational processes
  - Project tracking and task management
  - AI-powered agents for enhanced productivity
  - Audio calls and screenshare capabilities
  - AI-powered auto-translation for multinational collaboration

   **Architecture Diagram**: The detailed network topology diagram showing the interconnection between Allied Network A, Coalition Partner Network B, Enterprise Networks C & D, and shared infrastructure components should be placed here. The diagram illustrates the security boundaries, communication paths, and integration points between different organizational networks.

The network topology includes:

- **Network Isolation**: Each partner network operates independently with its own Mattermost deployment
- **Controlled Interconnection**: Secure communication channels between networks using HTTPS/VPN
- **Shared Resources**: Common channels and guest account management
- **External Integration**: Matrix & XMPP connectivity for broader ecosystem interoperability
- **Cloud Services**: Integration with M365, Teams, and Azure OpenAI where appropriate

Deployment Considerations
------------------------

**Security Requirements**
  - Network segmentation and boundary protection
  - Multi-factor authentication for all users
  - Encryption in transit and at rest
  - Regular security assessments and compliance audits
  - Information sharing agreements between organizations

**Performance and Scalability**
  - Load balancing across multiple server instances
  - Database optimization for multi-organizational data
  - Content delivery optimization for geographically distributed users
  - Redundancy and high availability planning

**Operational Management**
  - Centralized monitoring and alerting
  - Coordinated backup and disaster recovery procedures
  - Change management coordination between organizations
  - User lifecycle management across organizational boundaries

Use Cases
---------

This deployment pattern is ideal for:

- **Military and Defense**: Joint operations between allied forces
- **Government Agencies**: Inter-agency collaboration on shared initiatives  
- **Multinational Corporations**: Collaboration between subsidiaries and partners
- **Research Consortiums**: Multi-organizational research and development projects
- **Emergency Response**: Coordination between multiple response organizations

Implementation Steps
-------------------

1. **Network Planning**
   - Define organizational boundaries and security requirements
   - Plan network topology and interconnection methods
   - Establish information sharing policies and procedures

2. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Deploy independent Mattermost servers for each organization
   - Configure secure interconnection between networks
   - Set up shared infrastructure components

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Configure identity providers for each organization
   - Set up guest account management system
   - Define cross-organizational access policies

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test communication flows between organizations
   - Validate security controls and access restrictions
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with representative users

5. **Go-Live and Operations**
   - Execute phased rollout to user communities
   - Monitor system performance and security
   - Establish ongoing operational procedures
