This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Mattermost using Docker containers.

.. warning::

   - Mattermost server deployment using Docker is officially supported on Linux operating systems only.
   - macOS and Windows Docker deployments are supported for testing and development purposes only.
   - Docker is not ideal for High Availability (HA) because it lacks key features including automatic failover, shared storage, and load balancing. Docker also has challenges managing multiple nodes and recovering from failures. We recommend :doc:`deploying on Kubernetes </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>` for HA for these features to ensure reliability.

Install Docker
--------------

If you don't have Docker installed, follow the instructions below based on your operating system. You'll need `Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`__ and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ (release 1.28 or later).

Deploy Mattermost on Docker
----------------------------

This section provides a quick start guide for deploying Mattermost on Docker by leveraging `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.

.. note::

   - The deployment configuration results in two separate containers: a container for the database and a container for the application. An optional third container results when using NGINX for reverse proxy.
   - Encountering issues with your Docker deployment? See the :doc:`Docker deployment troubleshooting </deployment-guide/server/docker-troubleshooting>` documentation for details.

.. note::

   **Resource limits:** Previous versions of the Docker deployment used ``pids_limit`` to constrain container processes. This caused PostgreSQL connection failures in production because PostgreSQL creates one process per connection, limiting deployments to ~90-95 concurrent connections with ``pids_limit: 100``. We now recommend using ``mem_limit`` instead to constrain resources while allowing normal connection scaling. See the `Mattermost Scaling for Enterprise documentation <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise.html>`__ for sizing guidance.

1. In a terminal window, clone the repository and enter the directory.

   .. code-block:: sh

      git clone https://github.com/mattermost/docker
      cd docker

2. Create your ``.env`` file by copying and adjusting the ``env.example`` file.

   .. code-block:: sh

      cp env.example .env

   .. important::

      - At a minimum, you must edit the ``DOMAIN`` value in the ``.env`` file to correspond to the domain for your Mattermost server.
      - We recommend configuring the :ref:`Support Email <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:support email address>` via ``MM_SUPPORTSETTINGS_SUPPORTEMAIL``. This is the email address your users will contact when they need help.

3. Create the required directories and set their permissions.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir -p ./volumes/app/mattermost/{config,data,logs,plugins,client/plugins,bleve-indexes}
      sudo chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost

4. *(Optional)* Configure TLS for NGINX. If you're not using the included NGINX reverse proxy, you can skip this step.

Create a new certificate and key
---------------------------------

   .. code-block:: sh

      bash scripts/issue-certificate.sh -d <YOUR_MM_DOMAIN> -o ${PWD}/certs

To include the certificate and key, uncomment the following lines in your ``.env`` file and ensure they point to the appropriate files.

   .. code-block:: sh

      #CERT_PATH=./certs/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DOMAIN}/fullchain.pem
      #KEY_PATH=./certs/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DOMAIN}/privkey.pem

Use a pre-existing certificate and key
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir -p ./volumes/web/cert
   cp <PATH-TO-PRE-EXISTING-CERT>.pem ./volumes/web/cert/cert.pem
   cp <PATH-TO-PRE-EXISTING-KEY>.pem ./volumes/web/cert/key-no-password.pem

To include the certificate and key, ensure the following lines in your ``.env`` file points to the appropriate files.

   .. code-block:: sh

      CERT_PATH=./volumes/web/cert/cert.pem
      KEY_PATH=./volumes/web/cert/key-no-password.pem

5. Deploy Mattermost.

Deploy without using the included NGINX
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml up -d

To access your new Mattermost deployment, navigate to ``http://<YOUR_MM_DOMAIN>:8065/`` in your browser.

To shut down your deployment:

   .. code-block:: sh
  
      docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml down

Deploy using the included NGINX
-------------------------------

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up -d

To access your new Mattermost deployment via HTTPS, navigate to ``https://<YOUR_MM_DOMAIN>/`` in your browser.

To shut down your deployment:

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml down

6. Create your first Mattermost system admin user, :doc:`invite more users </end-user-guide/collaborate/manage-channel-members>`, and explore the Mattermost platform. 

Configure SSO With GitLab (Optional)
-------------------------------------

To use SSO with GitLab with a self-signed certificate, you have to add the PKI chain for your authority. This is required to avoid the ``Token request failed: certificate signed by unknown authority`` error.

To add the PKI chain, uncomment the following line in your ``.env`` file, and ensure it points to your ``pki_chain.pem`` file:

.. code-block:: sh

   #GITLAB_PKI_CHAIN_PATH=<path_to_your_gitlab_pki>/pki_chain.pem

Then uncomment the following line in your ``docker-compose.yml`` file, and ensure it points to the same ``pki_chain.pem`` file:

.. code-block:: sh

   # - ${GITLAB_PKI_CHAIN_PATH}:/etc/ssl/certs/pki_chain.pem:ro

Upgrade from mattermost-docker
-------------------------------

The `mattermost-docker <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker>`__ GitHub repository is deprecated. Visit the `mattermost/docker <https://github.com/mattermost/docker>`_ GitHub repository to access the official Docker deployment solution for Mattermost.

To migrate from an existing ``mattermost/mattermost-prod-app`` image, we recommend migrating to either ``mattermost/mattermost-enterprise-edition`` or ``mattermost/mattermost-team-edition`` images, which are the official images supported by Mattermost. These images support PostgreSQL v11+ databases, which we know has been a long-running challenge for the community, and you will not lose any features or functionality by moving to these new images.

For additional help or questions, please refer to `this issue <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker/issues/489>`__.

Install a different version of Mattermost
-----------------------------------------

1. Shut down your deployment.

2. Run ``git pull`` to fetch any recent changes to the repository, paying attention to any potential ``env.example`` changes.

3. Adjust the ``MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG`` in the ``.env`` file to point your desired `enterprise <https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-enterprise-edition/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated>`__ or `team <https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-team-edition/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated>`__ image version.

   .. important::

      **For production environments**, we recommend using specific version tags such as ``MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=release-10.5`` rather than generic tags like ``MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=release-10``. Generic ``release-x`` tags are intended for development use only and do not automatically receive new patch releases within that major version. Using specific version tags ensures a more reproducible and deterministic environment for your production deployment.

4. Redeploy Mattermost.

Troubleshooting
----------------

Troubleshooting your Docker deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If deploying on an M1 Mac and encountering permission issues in the Docker container, `redo the third step <#create-the-required-directores-and-set-their-permissions>`__ and skip this command:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost

If having issues deploying on Docker generally, ensure the docker daemon is enabled and running:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo systemctl enable --now docker

To remove all data and settings for your Mattermost deployment:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo rm -rf ./volumes

Troubleshooting PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For quick start deployments, you can change the Postgres username and/or password (recommended) in the ``.env`` file. If your database is managed externally, you'll need to change the password in your database management tool. Then, update the ``.env`` file with the new credentials.

Troubleshooting TLS & NGINX

For an in-depth guide to configuring the TLS certificate and key for Nginx, please refer to `this document in the repository <https://github.com/mattermost/docker/blob/main/docs/issuing-letsencrypt-certificate.md>`__.

Trial Mattermost using Docker Preview
-------------------------------------

Looking for a way to evaluate Mattermost on a single local machine using Docker? We recommend using the `Mattermost Docker Preview Image <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker-preview>`_ to install Mattermost in Preview Mode.

.. important::

   - This local image is self-contained (i.e., it has an internal database and works out of the box). Dropping a container using this image removes data and configuration as expected. You can see the :doc:`configuration settings </administration-guide/configure/configuration-settings>` documentation to learn more about customizing your trial deployment.
   - **Preview Mode** shouldn't be used in a production environment, as it uses a known password string, contains other non-production configuration settings, has email disabled, keeps no persistent data (all data lives inside the container), and doesn't support upgrades. 
   - If you are planning to use the calling functionality in **Preview Mode** on a non-local environment, you should ensure that the server is running on a secure (HTTPs) connection and that the :ref:`network requirements <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:network>` to run calls are met.

1. Install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started/>`__.

2. Once you have Docker, run the following command in a terminal window:

  .. code-block:: sh

   docker run --name mattermost-preview -d --publish 8065:8065 --publish 8443:8443 mattermost/mattermost-preview

3. When Docker is done fetching the image, navigate to ``http://localhost:8065/`` in your browser to preview Mattermost.
4. Select **Don't have an account** in the top right corner of the screen to create an account for your preview instance. If you don't see this option, ensure that the :ref:`Enable open server <administration-guide/configure/authentication-configuration-settings:enable open server>` configuration setting is enabled. This setting is disabled for self-hosted Mattermost deployments by default.
5. Log in to your preview instance with your user credentials.

Troubleshooting your preview deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Preview Mode** Docker instance for Mattermost is designed for product evaluation, and sets ``SendEmailNotifications=false`` so the product can function without enabling email. See the :doc:`Configuration Settings </administration-guide/configure/configuration-settings>` documentation to customize your deployment.

To update your Mattermost preview image and container, you must first stop and delete your existing **mattermost-preview** container by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

  docker pull mattermost/mattermost-preview
  docker stop mattermost-preview
  docker rm mattermost-preview

Once the new image is pulled and the container is stopped and deleted you need to run the ``docker run`` command from above.

.. important::
  On Linux, include ``sudo`` in front of all ``docker`` commands.

To access a shell inside the container, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   docker exec -ti mattermost-preview /bin/bash

.. note::

   See the :doc:`deployment troubleshooting </deployment-guide/deployment-troubleshooting>` documentation for resolutions to common deployment issues.
