Deploy for Mission Partner Collaboration
======================================

Overview
--------

Mission partner collaboration requires secure information sharing between allied networks, coalition partners, and multi-organizational entities while maintaining strict security boundaries. These environments demand granular access controls, data segregation, and cross-network communication capabilities without compromising operational security.

Mattermost enables secure mission partner collaboration by providing isolated communication channels, federated authentication, and controlled information sharing between partner organizations. The platform ensures that sensitive mission data remains protected while enabling effective collaboration across organizational boundaries.

This deployment architecture supports coalition operations, joint missions, and inter-agency collaboration where multiple organizations need to coordinate activities while maintaining their own security domains.

Architecture components
-----------------------

The mission partner collaboration architecture includes the following components:

**Partner Networks:** Independent organizational networks, each with their own security boundaries, identity providers, and operational requirements.

**Partner Users:** Users from different organizations who need to collaborate on shared missions while maintaining their home organization's authentication and security policies.

**Identity Federation:** Cross-organizational identity management that allows users to authenticate using their home organization's credentials while accessing shared collaboration spaces.

**Mattermost Deployment:** Mattermost deployed in a neutral or hosting organization's infrastructure, configured to support multi-tenant operations with strict data segregation.

**Mattermost Server:** Core application server configured for mission partner collaboration, including:

- **Multi-Tenant Messaging:** Secure channels that can be shared between partner organizations with granular access controls.

- **Federated Authentication:** Support for multiple identity providers, allowing users to authenticate with their home organization's credentials.

- **Data Segregation:** Logical separation of data between different partner organizations to ensure information security.

- **Cross-Network Integration:** Secure APIs and integrations that enable information sharing while maintaining security boundaries.

- **Audit and Compliance:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring to track cross-organizational information sharing and maintain compliance.

**Security Gateway:** Network security infrastructure that controls and monitors traffic between partner networks and the shared Mattermost environment.

**Shared Infrastructure:** Computing, storage, and networking resources that support the collaborative environment while maintaining security isolation.

Operational Best Practices
--------------------------

The following best practices ensure secure and effective mission partner collaboration:

Multi-Tenant Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implement strict tenant isolation to ensure that partner organizations' data remains segregated:

- Configure role-based access controls (RBAC) that respect organizational boundaries
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies to prevent unauthorized information sharing
- Use network segmentation to isolate partner traffic
- Deploy encryption in transit and at rest for all inter-organizational communications

Identity and Access Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy federated identity management that supports multiple partner organizations:

- Configure SAML or OIDC federation with each partner organization's identity provider
- Implement just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning for seamless access
- Use attribute-based access control (ABAC) to enforce fine-grained permissions
- Regularly audit and review cross-organizational access rights

Compliance and Governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Establish governance frameworks that satisfy all partner organizations' requirements:

- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all cross-organizational activities
- Configure data retention policies that comply with all partners' regulatory requirements
- Establish incident response procedures that can coordinate across multiple organizations
- Regular compliance assessments and security reviews

Network Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy robust network security measures to protect inter-organizational communications:

- Use secure network protocols (TLS 1.3+) for all communications
- Implement network access control (NAC) to verify device compliance
- Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Use zero-trust network principles for all cross-organizational connections
