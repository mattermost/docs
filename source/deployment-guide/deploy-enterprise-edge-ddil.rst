Deploy for Enterprise to Edge DDIL Operations  
============================================

This reference architecture demonstrates how to deploy Mattermost for Enterprise to Edge operations in Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) communication environments. This deployment pattern ensures continuous collaboration capabilities even under challenging network conditions.

Overview
--------

Enterprise to Edge DDIL deployment enables organizations to maintain collaboration capabilities between enterprise headquarters and edge locations that may experience unreliable, intermittent, or limited connectivity. This architecture is designed for scenarios where edge operations must continue functioning independently while maintaining synchronization with enterprise systems when connectivity allows.
