Download
--------

Download and install the Mattermost mobile app from the `Apple App Store (iOS) <https://www.apple.com/app-store/>`__ or `Google Play Store (Android) <https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en>`__. When new mobile app releases become available, your mobile app is automatically updated.

If you prefer to manage distribution of the mobile app to your users, we recommend using an :doc:`EMM provider </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>` to maintain full control over the distribution process, as well as enforce or restrict specific security policies. See the deployment options below for details.
