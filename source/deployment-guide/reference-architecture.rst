Reference Architecture
=====================

This section provides reference architectures and deployment patterns for specialized Mattermost use cases. These architectures demonstrate how to deploy Mattermost in various enterprise, government, and collaborative scenarios while maintaining security, compliance, and operational requirements.

Overview
--------

The reference architectures in this section cover:

* **Application Architecture** - Core Mattermost architecture components and their relationships
* **Deploy for Out-of-Band Use** - Secure deployment patterns for air-gapped and isolated environments
* **Deploy for Mission Partner Collaboration** - Multi-organization collaboration with controlled information sharing
* **Deploy for Enterprise to Edge DDIL Operations** - Enterprise-to-edge deployment for Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) environments
* **Deploy for Sovereign Collaboration in Microsoft Teams** - Integration patterns for sovereign cloud environments with Microsoft Teams

Each reference architecture provides:

- Architectural diagrams and component relationships
- Security considerations and best practices  
- Network topology and connectivity requirements
- Implementation guidance and configuration examples
- Use case scenarios and operational considerations

These architectures serve as starting points and can be adapted to meet specific organizational requirements and compliance needs.
