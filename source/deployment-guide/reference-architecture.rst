Reference Architecture
=====================

This section provides specialized deployment architectures for organizations requiring sovereign collaboration, mission-partner coordination, and enterprise-to-edge operations. These reference architectures address unique security, compliance, and operational requirements for critical infrastructure, defense, and regulated industries.

Architecture Overview
---------------------

These reference architectures build upon the core :doc:`Application Architecture </deployment-guide/application-architecture>` to address specialized deployment scenarios:

**Sovereign and Compliance-First Deployments** - Architectures that maintain full data control and regulatory compliance while enabling modern collaboration capabilities.

**Multi-Organizational and Coalition Operations** - Secure sharing and coordination patterns that preserve organizational boundaries while enabling joint mission execution.

**Edge and Disconnected Operations** - Resilient deployment patterns that maintain operational continuity in challenging network environments including air-gapped, intermittent, and bandwidth-constrained scenarios.

Each architecture provides comprehensive guidance on:

- Component deployment and configuration
- Security considerations and implementation
- Network topology and integration requirements
- Operational best practices and maintenance procedures
- Scaling and performance optimization strategies

Choose the architecture that best matches your operational requirements, security posture, and deployment environment.
