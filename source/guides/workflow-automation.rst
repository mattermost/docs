Mattermost Playbooks provides structure, monitoring and automation for repeatable, team-based processes integrated with the Mattermost platform. Playbooks are :doc:`configurable checklists </repeatable-processes/work-with-tasks>` for teams to achieve :doc:`specific and predictable outcomes </repeatable-processes/metrics-and-goals>`, such as incident response, software release management, and logistical operations.

Playbooks monitor channels for keywords or user actions to trigger a structured process, which brings up a set of individual or shared tasks, each associated with manual or automated actions. As playbooks are executed, some may have requirements for :doc:`broadcasting status updates to stakeholders </repeatable-processes/notifications-and-updates>` at regular intervals, to populate workflow dashboards by conducting :ref:`retrospectives <repeatable-processes/metrics-and-goals:configure retrospectives before a run>` after the core process is complete, or other customer requirements as exit criteria for a :doc:`playbook “run” </repeatable-processes/work-with-runs>`. 

:doc:`Advanced permissions </repeatable-processes/share-and-collaborate>` are also available to delegate and manage playbook controls in larger organizations.
