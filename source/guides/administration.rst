Mattermost Administration Guide
===============================

This guide is for people who administer an existing Mattermost server. It’s divided into three parts:

* `The Basics <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administration.html#the-basics>`__ - An overview of standard configurations and features.
* `Cloud Admin <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administration.html#cloud-admin>`__ - Detailed information about admin capabilities of Mattermost Cloud workspaces.
* `Self-Hosted Admin <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administration.html#self-hosted-admin>`__ - Detailed information about admin capabilities of self-hosted Mattermost servers.

If you’re looking for resources to help you install, deploy, and scale your self-hosted Mattermost server, refer to the :doc:`Mattermost Deployment Guide </guides/deployment>`.

* **Configuration Overview** - Mattermost offers extensive configuration options for both :doc:`self-hosted Mattermost servers </configure/configuration-settings>` and :doc:`Mattermost cloud workspaces </configure/cloud-site-configuration>`.
* **Authentication** - All versions of Mattermost provide basic authentication, :doc:`multi-factor authentication </onboard/multi-factor-authentication>`, and :doc:`Gitlab SSO </onboard/sso-gitlab>` out of the box. Professional and Enterprise versions of Mattermost also include :doc:`Active Directory / LDAP </onboard/ad-ldap>` and SSO for :doc:`OpenID </onboard/sso-openidconnect>`, :doc:`Google </onboard/sso-google>`, and :doc:`Office365 </onboard/sso-office>`.

Professional and Enterprise versions also include :doc:`advanced permissions control </onboard/advanced-permissions>` to customize which users can perform specific actions, and :doc:`system admin roles </onboard/system-admin-roles>` to grant admins from your organization access to specific areas of the Mattermost System Console.
