This guide is for people who administer an existing Mattermost server using the System Console, the ``config.json`` file, or through the management of environment variables.

As a system admin, access the System Console by selecting the **Product** |product-list| menu and selecting **System Console**.

This administrative guide is divided into 4 parts:

* :doc:`Get started </guides/get-started-with-administration>` - An overview of standard configurations and features for both self-hosted and Cloud deployments.
* :doc:`Cloud workspace management </guides/cloud-workspace-management>` - Detailed information about admin capabilities of Mattermost Cloud deployments.
* :doc:`Self-hosted administration </guides/self-hosted-administration>` - Detailed information about admin capabilities of self-hosted Mattermost servers.
* :doc:`Other resources </guides/other-administration-resources>` - Additional migration, conversion, and troubleshooting resources.

If youâ€™re looking for resources to help you install, deploy, and scale your self-hosted Mattermost server, see the :doc:`Mattermost Deployment Guide </guides/deployment>`.
