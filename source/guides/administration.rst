Mattermost administration guide
===============================

This guide is for people who administer an existing Mattermost server. It’s divided into three parts:

* `The basics <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administration.html#the-basics>`__ - An overview of standard configurations and features.
* `Cloud admin <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administration.html#cloud-admin>`__ - Detailed information about admin capabilities of Mattermost Cloud workspaces.
* `Self-hosted admin <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administration.html#self-hosted-admin>`__ - Detailed information about admin capabilities of self-hosted Mattermost servers.

If you’re looking for resources to help you install, deploy, and scale your self-hosted Mattermost server, refer to the :doc:`Mattermost Deployment Guide </guides/deployment>`.
