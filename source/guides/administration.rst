This guide is for people who administer an existing Mattermost server. It’s divided into four parts:

* `Get started </guides/administration.html#get-started>`__ - An overview of standard configurations and features for both self-hosted and Cloud workspaces.
* `Cloud workspace management </guides/administration.html#workspace-management>`__ - Detailed information about admin capabilities of Mattermost Cloud workspaces.
* `Self-hosted administration </guides/administration.html#self-hosted-admin>`__ - Detailed information about admin capabilities of self-hosted Mattermost servers.
* `Other resources </guides/administration.html#other-resources>`__ - Additional migration, conversion, and troubleshooting resources.

If you’re looking for resources to help you install, deploy, and scale your self-hosted Mattermost server, see the :doc:`Mattermost Deployment Guide </guides/deployment>`.
