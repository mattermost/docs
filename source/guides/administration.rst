* :doc:`Cloud workspace management </guides/cloud-workspace-management>` - Detailed information about admin capabilities of Mattermost Cloud workspaces.
* :doc:`Self-hosted administration </guides/self-hosted-administration>` - Detailed information about admin capabilities of self-hosted Mattermost servers.
* :doc:`Other resources </guides/other-administration-resources>` - Additional migration, conversion, and troubleshooting resources.

If you’re looking for resources to help you install, deploy, and scale your self-hosted Mattermost server, see the :doc:`Mattermost Deployment Guide </guides/deployment>`.
