The Mattermost Playbooks plugin enables you to create and manage pre-built, configurable checklists that define a repeatable process for teams to achieve specific and predictable outcomes. With playbooks, development teams can orchestrate prescribed workflows and define, streamline, and document complex, recurring operations. Playbooks help you stay in command with integrated communication, collaboration, and status dashboards to manage your entire workflow lifecycle.
