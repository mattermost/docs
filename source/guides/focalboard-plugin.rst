Focalboard plugin
=================

The Focalboard plugin enables your team to manage projects and tasks via a familiar Kanban board structure. Keep everyone in your team and organization in the loop to stay on schedule with clearly defined tasks, owners, checklists, and deadlines. Keep everything your team needs in one place, including documents, images, and important hyperlinks.

.. important::

  From Mattermost v8.0, Mattermost Boards is now operating as the Focalboard plugin and can be `enabled or disabled in the System Console <configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#id9>`__. To contribute to this open source project, visit the `Focalboard repository <https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/>`__ on GitHub.
