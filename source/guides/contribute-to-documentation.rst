Contribute to this site
========================

Mattermost has a diverse community that extends well beyond those who write code for our core projects. We value every contributor who helps make Mattermost better for everyone, from the community members who translate the Mattermost platform into languages beyond English, to those who write documentation and beyond. 

If youâ€™re interested in contributing to Mattermost, why not help improve the product documentation?

How to get started
------------------

The fastest way to get started with a documentation contribution is to find something you want to change in the documentation, such as a typo or link fix, or updating content for clarity. Once you've found a page you want to update, select **Edit** in the top-right corner of that page.

    :alt: Contribute to Mattermost documentation by selecting the Edit option located in the top right corner of every documentation page.

First time contributor?
-----------------------

In a GitHub pull request, you can make changes as if you were fixing any other Mattermost product issue or bug. If you're new to contributing to documentation using pull requests in GitHub, the following `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8ROl9wiHr8>`__ will help you get started:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 50%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8ROl9wiHr8" alt="Video on creating pull requests in GitHub" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 95%;"></iframe>
   </div>

See our `contribution <https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/why-contribute/#you-want-to-help-with-content>`__ documentation to learn more about the contribution opportunities available.

Where to find more information
------------------------------

If you'd like to take on a project with larger scope across multiple pages at a time, you'll want to be able to generate the documentation locally on demand to review your changes. See the product documentation `README <https://github.com/mattermost/docs#readme>`__ documentation to learn how to build the product documentation locally on your own system. 

Are you interested in contributing to the Mattermost developer or API reference documentation? See the additional README links below for details on generating documentation locally:

- `Mattermost Developer README <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation#readme>`__
- `API reference README <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-api-reference#readme>`__

Thank you again for your support. If you have any questions, reach out to us in the `Documentation Working Group channel <https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group>`__ on the Community Mattermost workspace.
