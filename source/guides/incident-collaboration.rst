Mattermost Incident Collaboration
=================================

What is Incident Collaboration?
-------------------------------

Incidents are situations which require an immediate response, and incidents benefit from a clearly defined process that guides toward resolution. Mattermost Incident Collaboration equips your team to coordinate, manage, and resolve incidents from within Mattermost:

* Starting an incident automatically creates a dedicated incident channel to coordinate discussion. 
  
  - Use custom categories in the channel sidebar to streamline access to ongoing incidents.

* Playbooks define the tasks toward resolution as your team manages the incident.
  
  - Define your playbooks in advance with automated actions such as creating a Jira ticket, starting a Zoom call, or finding out who is on-call in Opsgenie.

* Reviewing the timeline and conversation helps refine the process for future such incidents.
  
  - Export the incident channel conversation to conduct a post-mortem review.

Delivering more reliable services requires an efficient resolution process. Use Mattermost Incident Collaboration not only to resolve incidents more efficiently, but also to learn from past incidents and refine the process your team relies upon for success.

Anatomy of an incident
----------------------

Mattermost Incident Collaboration has the following components:

* **Incidents** are situations that require an immediate response. Every reported incident results in a newly-created, public or private incident channel exposing a custom user interface for collaboration and resolution.
* **Playbooks** define the process to guide an incident toward resolution. Playbooks are created in advance by defining the tasks, checklists, and other configuration used during an incident.
* **Tasks** are the discrete actions to be taken when resolving an incident. As the necessary work is completed, the team should mark the tasks as complete. During an incident, tasks may be assigned to a member of the incident channel to communicate ownership.
* The **Commander** is a defined role during the incident. This person is responsible for ensuring forward momentum on resolving the incident. By default, the reporter of the incident starts as the commander, but the commander may be changed at any time to another member of the incident channel.
* **Slash commands** may be assigned to tasks defined in the playbook to help to streamline common actions.
