# Configuration Settings
Configuration settings can be modified by system administrators from the system console or directly in the config.json file.

## System Console Settings

The System Console user interface lets system administrators manage a Mattermost server and multiple teams from a web-based user interface. The first user added to a new Mattermost install is assigned the system administrator role and can access the System Console from the main menu of any team. 

Setting changes in the System Console are stored in `config/config.json`. 

Note: For any setting not explicitly set in `config.json` the Mattermost server will use the default value as documented here, and which can be observed in the default `config/config.json` file included in each Mattermost release. 

### Service Settings

General settings to configure the listening address, login security, testing, webhooks and service integration of Mattermost. 

#### System

**Listen Address** (`"ListenAddress": ":8065"`)  

The IP address on which to listen and the port on which to bind. Entering ":8065" will bind to all interfaces or you can choose one like `127.0.0.1:8065`. Changing this will require a server restart before taking effect.

**Maximum Login Attempts** (`"MaximumLoginAttempts": 10`)  

Failed login attempts allowed before a user is locked out and required to reset their password via email.

Security note: Enabling this feature makes these connections susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Allow Cross-origin Requests** (`"AllowCorsFrom": ""`)

**Enable Outgoing Webhooks** (`"EnableOutgoingWebhooks": true`)    

Developers building integrations can create webhook tokens for public channels. Trigger words are used to fire new message events to external integrations. For security reasons, outgoing webhooks are only available in public channels.

Note: The `http://push-test.mattermost.com` provided for testing push notifications prior to compiling your own service please make sure [to read about its limitations.](http://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/push.html#push-notifications-for-team-edition-users) 

#### Troubleshooting Push Notifications 

To confirm push notifications are working: 

1. Set **System Console** > **Email Settings** > **Send Push Notifications** to `true`.
2. Set **System Console** > **Email Settings** > **Send Push Notifications** to `true` (if using Mattermost 1.4 or earlier).
3. Set **System Console** > **Email Settings** > **Push Notification Server** to `http://push.mattermost.com` if using Enterprise Edition or if using Team Edition, set the value to `http://push-test.mattermost.com`.
4. Download and install [the Mattermost iOS app from iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mattermost/id984966508?mt=8) on your iPhone or iPad and log in to your team site. 
5. Close the app on your device, and close any other connections to your team site.
6. Wait 5 minutes and have another team member send you a direct messages, which should trigger a push notification to the Mattermost app on your mobile device. 
7. You should receive a push notification on your device alerting you of the direct message. 

If you did not receive an alert: 

1. Set **System Console** > **Log Settings** > **File Log Level** to `DEBUG` (make sure to set this back to `INFO` after troubleshooting to save disk space). 
2. Repeat the above steps
3. Go to **System Console** > **OTHER** > **Logs** and copy the log output into a file 
4. For Enterprise Edition customers, [submit a support request with the file attached](https://mattermost.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). For Team Edition users, please start a thread in the [Troubleshooting forum](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/how-to-use-the-troubleshooting-forum/150) for peer-to-peer support.

The Base DN is the Distinguished Name of the location where Mattermost should start its search for users in the LDAP tree.

**Bind Username** (`"BindUsername": ""`)  

The username used to perform the LDAP search. This should typically be an account created specifically for use with Mattermost. It should be a read only account with access limited to the portion of the LDAP tree specified in the BaseDN field.

**Bind Password** (`"BindPassword": ""`)  

Password of the user given in “Bind Username”.

This is also the value used to log in to Mattermost in the “LDAP Username” field on the sign in page. Normally this attribute is the same as the “Username Attribute” field above. If your team typically uses domain\username to sign in to other services with LDAP, you may choose to put domain\username in this field to maintain consistency between sites.

**Query Timeout (seconds)** (`"QueryTimeout": 60`)  

The timeout value for queries to the LDAP server. Increase this value if you are getting timeout errors caused by a slow LDAP server.

## Config.json settings not in System Console

System Console allows an IT Admin to update settings defined in `config.json`. However there are a number of settings in `config.json` unavailable in the System Console and require update from the file itself. We describe them here: 

### Service Settings

**Enable OAuth Service Provider** (`"EnableOAuthServiceProvider": false`)  

`true`: Allow Mattermost to function as an OAuth provider, allowing 3rd party apps access to your user store for authentication.

**WebSocket Secure Port** (`"WebsocketSecurePort" : 443`)  

When present in `config.json`, this setting defines the port on which the secured WebSocket will listen using the `wss` protocol. Otherwise it defaults to `443`. When the client attempts to make a WebSocket connection it first checks to see if the page is loaded with HTTPS. If so, it will use the secure WebSocket connection. If not, it will use the unsecure WebSocket connection. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS ONLY OPERATE UNDER HTTPS AND WSS. 

**WebSocket Port** (`WebsocketPort": 80`)  

When present in `config.json`, this setting defines the port on which the unsecured WebSocket will listen using the `ws` protocol. Otherwise it defaults to `80`. When the client attempts to make a WebSocket connection it first checks to see if the page is loaded with HTTPS. If so, it will use the secure WebSocket connection. If not, it will use the unsecure WebSocket connection. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS ONLY OPERATE UNDER HTTPS AND WSS.
