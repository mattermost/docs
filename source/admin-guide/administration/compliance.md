# Compliance exports with oversight protection 

_Basic reporting available in Enterprise Edition 2.1, full features available May 16, 2016_

Turning on this feature enables compliance exports to be produced from the System Console with each export and download action logged in an audit history to enable oversight and prevent unauthorized queries. 

Compliance exports can be filtered to date range, user account, and keyword list and requests from queries can be downloaded from the user interface in .csv format, with a .json metafile documenting the query, as well as placed in a pre-defined directory. 

Each export and each download action taken from the user interface is recorded in an audit log, including the user account taking the action, the action and a datetime stamp. 

An option is also available to generate compliance reports on a daily basis.
