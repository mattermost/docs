AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker Setup
==================================

The following instructions use Docker to install Mattermost in *Preview
Mode* for exploring product functionality. This configuration should not
be used in production, as it's using a known password string and
contains other non-production configuration settings.

1.  From your `AWS
    console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home>`__ select
    **Elastic Beanstalk** under the Compute section.
2.  Select **Create New Application** from the top right.
3.  Name your Elastic Beanstalk application and click **Next**,
4.  Select **Create web server** on the New Enviroment page.
5.  If asked, select **Create an IAM role and instance profile**, then
    click **Next**.
6.  On the Enviroment Type page,

    a. Set Predefined Configuration to **Docker** under the generic
       heading in the drop-down list.
    b. Set Environment Type to **Single instance** in the drop-down
       list.
    c. Click **Next**.

7.  For Application Source, select **Upload your own** and upload the
    Dockerrun.aws.zip file from
    https://github.com/mattermost/platform/tree/master/docker/\ (select
    version you'd like to use), then click **Next**.
8.  Type an Environment Name and URL. Make sure the URL is available by
    clicking **Check availability**, then click **Next**.
9.  The options on the Additional Resources page may be left at default
    unless you wish to change them. Click **Next**.
10. On the Configuration Details page,

    a. Select an Instance Type of **t2.small** or larger.
    b. The remaining options may be left at their default values unless
       you wish to change them. Click **Next**.

11. Environment tags may be left blank. Click **Next**.
12. You will be asked to review your information, then click **Launch**.
13. It may take a few minutes for beanstalk to launch your environment.
    If the launch is successful, you will see a see a large green
    checkmark and the Health status should change to “Green”.
14. Test your environment by clicking the domain link next to your
    application name at the top of the dashboard. Alternatively, enter
    the domain into your browser in the form
    ``http://<your-ebs-application-url>.elasticbeanstalk.com``. You can
    also map your own domain if you wish. If everything is working
    correctly, the domain should navigate you to the Mattermost signup
    page. Enjoy exploring Mattermost!

Configuration Settings
----------------------

See `Configuration Settings <../administration/config-settings.md>`__
documentation to customize your deployment.

(Recommended) Enable Email
--------------------------

The default single-container Docker instance for Mattermost is designed
for product evaluation, and sets ``SendEmailNotifications=false`` so the
product can function without enabling email. To see the product's full
functionality, enabling SMTP email is recommended.
