Mattermost Playbooks is included in Mattermost self-hosted and Mattermost Cloud workspace. You can access Playbooks via the Product menu in the top-left corner of Mattermost.

Access playbooks and runs
-------------------------

You can access Playbooks within Channels using the **Toggle Playbook List** icon in the channel header to open the right-hand sidebar (RHS). In the RHS, you'll find playbooks you can run as well as templates.

* Playbooks are preconfigured workflows, applied to a specific situation or event, that are refined over time with steps and processes that your team agree on.
* Playbook Templates are basic workflows that you can use to get started quickly. As you learn more about your workflows, you can customize them into specific playbooks.

To open a playbook and view its statistics, select the playbook name. To begin a run using a specific playbook, select **Run** next to that playbook's name.

To access runs, select the Product menu in the top-left corner of Mattermost, then select **Playbooks**. In the runs list, you can select a run to view more details, such as the overview and retrospective. This is an easy way to assess all the active runs to which you have access.

Playbook preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The playbook preview is a landing page that provides a summary of the playbook's components. This gives you insight into the playbook, as it's applied in a run, without having to join a active run.

View run details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're in a channel with an active run, select the **Toggle Run Details** icon in the channel header to open the RHS to view the run details. Information such as run name and description can be edited in-line, and the checklists can be collapsed and filtered based on their status.

To find all playbook runs, open **Product menu > Playbooks**, and then select any playbook name. Next, select **Runs** from the navigation bar. and choose a run to view its overview. Select **Go to channel** to open the run's channel.
