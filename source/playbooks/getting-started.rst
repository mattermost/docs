Accessing and Navigating Playbooks
----------------------------------

* From the Main Menu, select **Playbooks** to view runs, configure playbooks, and modify settings. System Admins have unrestricted access.
* From the channel header, select the **Playbook** icon in the channel header to open the right-hand sidebar. From there, you can start a new playbook run using a playbook or a playbook template.

Finding playbook runs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're in a channel with an active run, select the **Playbook** icon in the channel header to open the right-hand sidebar to view the run details. Information such as run name and description can be edited in-line, and the checklists can be collapsed and filtered based on their status.

To find all playbook runs, select **Main Menu > Playbooks**. Select a run to view its overview. Select **Go to channel** to open the run's channel.

Viewing playbooks 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Playbooks are accessed via **Main Menu > Playbooks** in Mattermost, where you can also view a list of templates.

When you're in a channel that's not running a playbook, select the **Playbook** icon in the channel header to open the right-hand sidebar and view the list of playbooks and templates available for your team.
