Notifications and Updates
=========================

To help you keep track of your runs, tasks, and statuses, a daily digest is sent via Direct Message in Mattermost.

Daily digest
------------

Running playbooks in multiple channels can be overwhelming. The daily digest is sent once a day, in the morning. It lists the actionable items for each run, as well as any outstanding tasks or status updates required. Select the run name to move to that channel.

The digest is on by default. To turn it off, use the slash command ``/playbook settings digest off``.

Playbook to do
--------------

As you complete tasks and finish runs, you can update the details in the digest using the slash command ``/playbook todo``. This slash command can be run in any channel, Direct Message, or Group Message. Once run, it delivers an updated digest which includes a list of active runs you belong to.
