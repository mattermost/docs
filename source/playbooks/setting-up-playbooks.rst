Playbooks help streamline and manage complex processes while decreasing the risk of forgotten steps or tasks. They also support tool integration, status updates in a dedicated channel, and can be edited on the fly. When a playbook run is finished, you can review the entire run to assess any areas of improvement for the next run.

Playbooks are made up of:

- **Checklists:** The list of tasks to be completed for the run. Checklists can be edited ad-hoc during a run.
- **Templates:** Templates for frequently-used actions such as updates and reminders. You can create your own templates or use default ones.
- **Actions:** Automation options for inviting members, webhooks, welcome messages, channel export settings, and more.
- **Permissions:** Manage permissions at a channel and a playbook level.

Make checklists
----------------

1. Open Playbooks and select the **Playbooks** tab.
2. Start a **Blank Playbook**, or use the built-in template.
3. Name your playbook and provide a description.
4. Select the **Checklists** tab.

  You can start with the default checklist and edit it or you can delete it and select **+ New checklist**.

    * Within each checklist, select **+ New task** to add tasks that are meant to be completed together.
    * Drag and drop to reorganize checklists and tasks.
    * Add task descriptions to give additional context to members of the playbook. Descriptions support a limited form of Markdown, including text styling and hyperlinks.
    * Add a slash command to the task that can be executed by members of the playbook as needed.

5. Choose **Save**.
  
Configure templates
-------------------

Templates are standardized sets of content that are used for communicating reminders and updates. Open Playbooks and select the **Templates** tab.

Broadcast channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting up a dedicated broadcast channel is an easy way to centralize status updates, decrease noise, and remember where everything is. Configure a broadcast channel to which status updates will be copied. If you are not a member of the configured broadcast channel, **Unknown Channel** is displayed instead of the channel name.

Reminder timers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the default reminder timer used to prompt for regular updates. The reminder timer may be changed when a status update is written.

Update templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure a template to use for the first status update. Subsequent status updates will start with the text of the most recent update.

Define actions
--------------

You can customize actions associated with your playbook by setting up keyword triggers, automate member invites, and add a welcome message for new members.

Select the **Actions** tab to view the automation options available.

Keywords
~~~~~~~~

When you use the **Keywords** action any team member who has access to the playbook and who uses one of the listed keywords will see a message like this:

.. image:: ../images/Playbook-keyword-monitoring.png
   :alt: Set up keyword triggers to run playbooks when specified keywords are detected in Channel posts.

If you find your keywords result in too many false positives, consider refining your list and also consider that URLs used by run members may also contain monitored keywords.

Webhooks
~~~~~~~~

- For information about the webhook payload for run start, see the `PlaybookRunWebhookPayload struct <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/blob/b4c8058d8660efe35050bc7eb080e3819c7ab09c/server/app/playbook_run_service.go#L176-L185>`_. An example of the JSON payload for a run start `is available here <https://gist.github.com/icelander/b68f2bf2b4ffefec93400cb050211cf1>`_.
- For information about the webhook payload for status update, see the `PlaybookRunWebhookPayload struct <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/blob/b4c8058d8660efe35050bc7eb080e3819c7ab09c/server/app/playbook_run_service.go#L176-L185>`_. An example JSON payload for a status update `is available here <https://gist.github.com/icelander/2f9938ad68d1e0aa656f97969895d080>`_.

Set permissions
---------------

1. Go to **product menu > Playbooks**, and then select **Permissions**.

 * **Channel access**: Decide whether the automatically-created channel should be Public or Private within the team.
 * **Playbook access**: Share this playbook with other members of the team to allow them to use the playbook to start a run, as well as edit the playbook.

Edit a playbook
---------------

You can change a playbook's configuration at any time, but changes will only be applied to future incidents. Ongoing or ended incidents previously started from that playbook remain unchanged.

1. Go to **product menu > Playbooks**.
2. Find the playbook to be edited.

 * Only playbooks of which you are a member are listed. System Admins have unrestricted access to all playbooks on the team.

3. Select the name of the playbook.

 * To edit the playbook directly select the **Actions** menu next to the playbook name, then select **Edit**.
 * To access the playbook dashboard, select the hyperlinked playbook name.

4. Configure the playbook the same way a playbook is created or edited.

Copying and reusing playbooks
-----------------------------

Playbooks are repeatable workflows and sometimes it's easier to copy and improve rather than start from scratch. You can do this by duplicating a playbook in the **Playbooks** screen. Select the **...** under **Actions** and then select **Duplicate**. The copied playbook will have **Copy of** appended to its original name which you can edit.

To import a playbook, go to the **Playbooks** screen, select **Import**. Choose the team you're importing to, then select the JSON file. You can also export any playbook to JSON to easily share with other Mattermost servers.
