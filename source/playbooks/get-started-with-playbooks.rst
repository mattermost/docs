Get started with Mattermost Playbooks
=====================================

Access Mattermost playbooks from the Product Menu and select **Playbooks**.

Playbooks are workflows that can be repeated and refined over time. They can be applied to a range of situations and give stakeholders visibility into progress, process, and metrics.

Choose a template
-----------------

The first step is to choose the right template for your use case. There are pre-configured templates for specific scenarios. The checklists, actions, status updates, and retrospective settings for these templates may already be filled in and, where appropriate, enabled. You can always edit and adjust these settings - they're there to guide you - removing them doesn't negatively affect the playbook run.

You can also choose a blank template and start from scratch - this is a good option if your use case is unique.

Lastly, if you're unsure which option to choose, take a look at the **Learn how to use playbooks** template. This template breaks down the components of a playbook and you can also start a test run to see how everything fits together.

Playbook concepts
-----------------

If you're taking this option, here are some tips and tricks. 

First, make sure you have a repeatable process in mind - simply because this makes more sense. The primary goal of a playbook is to have a visible, editable workflow that stakeholders are able to access without having to be in the thick of things.
