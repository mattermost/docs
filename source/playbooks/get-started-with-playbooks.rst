Get started with Mattermost Playbooks
=====================================

Access Mattermost playbooks from the Product Menu and select **Playbooks**.

Playbooks are workflows that can be repeated and refined over time. They can be applied to a range of situations and give stakeholders visibility into progress, process, and metrics.

Choose a template
-----------------

The first step is to choose the right template for your use case. There are pre-configured templates for specific scenarios. The checklists, actions, status updates, and retrospective settings for these templates may already be filled in and, where appropriate, enabled. You can always edit and adjust these settings - they're there to guide you - removing them doesn't negatively affect the playbook run.

You can also choose a blank template and start from scratch - this is a good option if your use case is unique.

Lastly, if you're unsure which option to choose, take a look at the **Learn how to use playbooks** template. This template breaks down the components of a playbook and you can also start a test run to see how everything fits together. If you're taking this option, you can stop reading here and enjoy the test run.

If you'd prefer to start with a blank template, the next few sections are for you. It helps if you have a repeatable process in mind so you can apply what you know in order to get the most out of playbooks, but it's not a prerequisite.

Configure your playbook
-----------------------

Playbooks are configurable and editable. You can add tasks to checklists, include automation behaviors, and provide insights into your processes in the form of metrics. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you.
