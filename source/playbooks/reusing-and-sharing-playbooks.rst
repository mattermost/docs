Playbooks are repeatable workflows and sometimes it’s easier to copy and improve rather than start from scratch. 

You can do this by duplicating a playbook in the Playbooks screen. Select the **...** under **Actions** and then select **Duplicate**. The copied playbook will have **Copy of** appended to its original name which you can edit.

To import a playbook, go to the Playbooks screen, and select **Import**. Choose the team you’re importing to, then select the JSON file. You can also export any playbook to JSON to easily share with other Mattermost servers.

Channel export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exporting the contents of a channel requires the channel export plugin. See the `Channel Export plugin documentation <https://mattermost.gitbook.io/channel-export-plugin>`_ for more information.

.. note::

   Channel export is only available to Mattermost Enterprise customers. For more information, visit `https://mattermost.com/pricing <https://mattermost.com/pricing>`_.
