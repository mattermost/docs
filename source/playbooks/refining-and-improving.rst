Retrospectives help teams identify areas of improvement in workflows. Each time a playbook is run you can create and publish a retrospective for the team and stakeholders to review. Retrospective components are customized per playbook.

Configuring retrospectives before a run
----------------------------------------

Open Playbooks and select the **Playbooks** tab. Select the playbook and then select **Edit**. Select **Templates** and scroll down to the **Retrospective Reminder Interval** and **Retrospective Template** fields.

You can set a reminder to fill out the retrospective after a run is finished. The configured template is pre-populated in the run's retrospective.

Use the run timeline to help write an accurate retrospective. Events such as owner changes, status updates, and task assignments appear automatically. Selected posts may also be added to the timeline by using the post context menu.
