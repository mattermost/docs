Deploy Mattermost on Bitnami
=============================

Deploy your Mattermost Team Edition server in the cloud with one simple click using one of `several Bitnami cloud images <https://bitnami.com/stack/mattermost/cloud>`__.

Deployment options include:

- `Amazon Web Services <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-aws>`__
- `Microsoft Azure <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-azure>`__
- `Google Cloud Platform <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-googlecloud>`__

Alternatively, you may also deploy to `Debian 9 VMware virtual machines <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-debianvirtualmachine>`__.

If you migrate from Bitnami to a self-hosted installation with MySQL database, read these notes in our migration guide: `Migrating from Bitnami <../administration/migrating.html#migrating-from-bitnami>`__.
