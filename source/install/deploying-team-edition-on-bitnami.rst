Deploy Mattermost on Bitnami
=============================

Deploy your Mattermost Team Edition server in the cloud with one simple click using one of `several Bitnami cloud images <https://bitnami.com/stack/mattermost/cloud>`__.

Deployment options include:

- `Amazon Web Services <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-smvm2q422uo6c>`__
- `Microsoft Azure <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/bitnami.mattermost>`__
- `Google Cloud Platform <https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bitnami-launchpad/mattermost>`__

Alternatively, you may also deploy to `Debian 9 VMware virtual machines <https://bitnami.com/stack/mattermost/virtual-machine>`__.

If you migrate from Bitnami to a self-hosted installation with MySQL database, read these notes in our migration guide: `Migrating from Bitnami <https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-bitnami>`__.
