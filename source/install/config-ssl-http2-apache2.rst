.. _config-ssl-http2-apache2:

Configuring Apache2 with SSL and HTTP/2 (Unofficial)
=====================================================

.. important:: This unofficial guide is maintained by the Mattermost community and this deployment configuration is not yet officially supported by Mattermost, Inc. `Community testing, feedback and improvements are welcome and greatly appreciated <https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues/1295>`_. You can `edit this page on GitHub <https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/source/install/config-ssl-http2-apache2.rst>`_.

Once you've configured Apache2 as a proxy for your Mattermost Server, the easiest way to enable SSL on Apache2 is via Let's Encrypt and `Certbot <https://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntuxenial-apache>`_.

Once installed, run ``$ certbot --apache`` and follow the guide. Afterwards you should find a new configuration file in ``/etc/apache2/sites-available`` which should follow the format ``mysubdomain.mydomain.com-le-ssl.conf``.

When opened, edit it to look something like the following:

.. code-block:: apacheconf

	<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
	<VirtualHost *:443>
		ServerName mysubdomain.mydomain.com
		ServerAdmin hostmaster@mydomain.com
		ProxyPreserveHost On

		# setup the proxy
		<Proxy *>
		  Order allow,deny
		  Allow from all
		</Proxy>

		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/api/v3/users/websocket [NC,OR]
		RewriteCond %{HTTP:UPGRADE} ^WebSocket$ [NC,OR]
		RewriteCond %{HTTP:CONNECTION} ^Upgrade$ [NC]
		RewriteRule .* ws://127.0.0.1:8065%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,L]
		RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule .* http://127.0.0.1:8065%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,L]

		<Location /api/v3/users/websocket>
		  Require all granted
		  ProxyPass ws://127.0.0.1:8065/api/v3/users/websocket
		  ProxyPassReverse ws://127.0.0.1:8065/api/v3/users/websocket
		  ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain 127.0.0.1 mysubdomain.mydomain.com
		</Location>

		<Location />
		  Require all granted
		  ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8065/
		  ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8065/
		  ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain 127.0.0.1 mysubdomain.mydomain.com
		</Location>

		# Generated by Certbot
		SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/fullchain.pem
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/privkey.pem
		Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
	</VirtualHost>
	</IfModule>

1. Restart Apache2

    - On Ubuntu 14.04 and RHEL 6: ``sudo service apache2 restart``
    - On Ubuntu 16.04 and RHEL 7: ``sudo systemctl restart apache2``

2. Test that the site is working, that WebSockets are working, and if you enabled HTTP redirect to HTTPS during Certbot installation that the redirect is working.
3. Lastly, test your SSL configuration with https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html.

Using Certbot means that you shouldn't have to do anything in the configuration of Mattermost.
