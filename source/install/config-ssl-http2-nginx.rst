Configuring NGINX with SSL and HTTP/2
=====================================

Using SSL gives greater security by ensuring that communications between Mattermost clients and the Mattermost server are encrypted. It also allows you to configure NGINX to use the HTTP/2 protocol.

Although you can configure HTTP/2 without SSL, both Firefox and Chrome browsers support HTTP/2 on secure connections only.

You can use any certificate that you want, but these instructions show you how to download and install certificates from `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__, a free certificate authority.

.. note::
   If Let’s Encrypt is enabled, forward port 80 through a firewall, with `Forward80To443 <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#forward-port-80-to-443>`__ ``config.json`` setting set to ``true`` to complete the Let’s Encrypt certification.

**To configure SSL and HTTP/2:**

1. Log in to the server that hosts NGINX and open a terminal window.
2. Install git.

  If you are using Ubuntu or Debian:

  ``sudo apt-get install git``

  If you are using RHEL:

  ``sudo yum install git``

3. Clone the Let's Encrypt repository on GitHub.

  ``git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt``

4. Change to the ``letsencrypt`` directory.

  ``cd letsencrypt``

5. Stop NGINX.

  On Ubuntu 14.04 and RHEL 6.6:

  ``sudo service nginx stop``

  On Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04 and RHEL 7.1:

  ``sudo systemctl stop nginx``

6. Run ``netstat`` to make sure that nothing is listening on port 80.

  ``netstat -na | grep ':80.*LISTEN'``

7. Run the Let's Encrypt installer.

  ``./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone``

  When prompted, enter your domain name. After the installation is complete, you can find the certificate in the   ``/etc/letsencrypt/live`` directory.

8. Open the file ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost`` as root in a text editor and update the *server* section to incorporate the highlighted lines in the following sample. Make sure to replace *{domain-name}* with your own domain name, in 3 places.

    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        .
        .
        .


9. Restart NGINX.

  On Ubuntu 14.04 and RHEL 6.6:

  ``sudo service nginx start``

  On Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04 and RHEL 7.1:

  ``sudo systemctl start nginx``

10. Check that your SSL certificate is set up correctly.

  * Test the SSL certificate by visiting a site such as https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html
  * If there’s an error about the missing chain or certificate path, there is likely an intermediate certificate missing that needs to be included.

11. Configure ``cron`` so that the certificate will automatically renew every month.

  ``crontab -e``

  In the following line, use your own domain name in place of *{domain-name}*

  ``@monthly /home/ubuntu/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto certonly --reinstall --nginx -d {domain-name} && sudo service nginx reload``
