Configure NGINX with SSL and HTTP/2
-----------------------------------

NGINX is configured using a file in the ``/etc/nginx/sites-available`` directory. You need to create the file and then enable it. When creating the file, you need the IP address of your Mattermost server and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Mattermost website.

Using SSL gives greater security by ensuring that communications between Mattermost clients and the Mattermost server are encrypted. It also allows you to configure NGINX to use the HTTP/2 protocol.

Although you can configure HTTP/2 without SSL, both Firefox and Chrome browsers support HTTP/2 on secure connections only.

You can use any certificate that you want, but these instructions show you how to download and install certificates from `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__, a free certificate authority.

.. note::
   
   If Let’s Encrypt is enabled, forward port 80 through a firewall, with `Forward80To443 </configure/configuration-settings.html#forward-port-80-to-443>`__ ``config.json`` setting set to ``true`` to complete the Let’s Encrypt certification. See the `Let's Encrypt/Certbot documentation <https://certbot.eff.org>`_ for additional assistance.

1. Log in to the server that hosts NGINX and open a terminal window.

2. Open the your Mattermost ``nginx.conf`` file as *root* in a text editor, then update the ``{ip}`` address in the ``upstream backend`` to point towards Mattermost (such as ``127.0.0.1:8065``), and update the ``server_name`` to be your domain for Mattermost.

  .. note::
   
   - On Ubuntu this file is located at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/``. If you don't have this file, run ``sudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost``.
   - On CentOS/RHEL this file is located at ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/``. If you don't have this file, run ``sudo touch /etc/nginx/conf.d/mattermost``.
   - Note that the IP address included in the examples in this documentation may not match your network configuration. 
   - If you're running NGINX on the same machine as Mattermost, and NGINX resolves ``localhost`` to more than one IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), we recommend using ``127.0.0.1`` instead of ``localhost``.

       }
   }


3. Remove the existing default sites-enabled file by running ``sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`` (Ubuntu) or ``sudo rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default`` (RHEL 8).

4. Enable the Mattermost configuration by running ``sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mattermost`` (Ubuntu) or ``sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/conf.d/mattermost /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`` (RHEL 8).
   
5. Run ``sudo nginx -t`` to ensure your configuration is done properly. If you get an error, look into the NGINX config and make the needed changes to the file under ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost``.

6. Restart NGINX by running ``sudo systemctl start nginx``.

7. Verify that you can see Mattermost through the proxy by running ``curl http://localhost``.

  If everything is working, you will see the HTML for the Mattermost signup page. You will see invalid certificate when accessing through the IP or localhost. Use the full FQDN domain to verify if the SSL certificate has pinned properly and is valid.

8. Install and update Snap by running ``sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core``.

9. Install the Certbot package by running ``sudo snap install --classic certbot``.

10. Add a symbolic link to ensure Certbot can run by running ``sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot``.

11. Run the Let's Encrypt installer dry-run to ensure your DNS is configured properly by running ``sudo certbot certonly --dry-run``.

  This will prompt you to enter your email, accept the TOS, share your email, and select the domain you're activating certbot for. This will validate that your DNS points to this server properly and you are able to successfully generate a certificate. If this finishes successfully, proceed to step 12.
  
12. Run the Let's Encrypt installer by running ``sudo certbot``. This will run certbot and will automatically edit your NGINX config file for the site(s) selected.
  
13. Ensure your SSL is configured properly by running ``curl https://{your domain here}``

14. Finally, we suggest editing your config file again to increase your SSL security settings above the default Let's Encrypt. This is the same file from Step 2 above. Edit it to look like the below:

  .. code-block:: none

   upstream backend {
       server {ip}:8065;
      keepalive 32;

   }

15.  Check that your SSL certificate is set up correctly.

  * Test the SSL certificate by visiting a site such as https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html.
  * If there’s an error about the missing chain or certificate path, there is likely an intermediate certificate missing that needs to be included.

NGINX configuration FAQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why are Websocket connections returning a 403 error?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is likely due to a failing cross-origin check. A check is applied for WebSocket code to see if the ``Origin`` header is the same as the host header. If it's not, a 403 error is returned. Open the file ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost`` as *root* in a text editor and make sure that the host header being set in the proxy is dynamic:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 4

  location ~ /api/v[0-9]+/(users/)?websocket$ {
    proxy_pass            http://backend;
    (...)
    proxy_set_header      Host $host;
    proxy_set_header      X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
  }

Then in ``config.json`` set the ``AllowCorsFrom`` setting to match the domain being used by clients. You may need to add variations of the host name that clients may send. Your NGINX log will be helpful in diagnosing the problem.

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2

  "EnableUserAccessTokens": false,
  "AllowCorsFrom": "domain.com domain.com:443 im.domain.com",
  "SessionLengthWebInDays": 30,

For other troubleshooting tips for WebSocket errors, see `potential solutions here </install/troubleshooting.html#please-check-connection-mattermost-unreachable-if-issue-persists-ask-administrator-to-check-websocket-port>`__.

How do I setup an NGINX proxy with the Mattermost Docker installation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Find the name of the Mattermost network and connect it to the NGINX proxy.

.. code-block:: none

  docker network ls
  # Grep the name of your Mattermost network like "mymattermost_default".
  docker network connect mymattermost_default nginx-proxy

2. Restart the Mattermost Docker containers.

.. code-block:: none

  docker-compose stop app
  docker-compose start app

.. tip::

  You don't need to run the 'web' container, since NGINX proxy accepts incoming requests.

3. Update your ``docker-compose.yml`` file to include a new environment variable ``VIRTUAL_HOST`` and an ``expose`` directive.

.. code-block:: none

  environment:
    # set same as db credentials and dbname
    - MM_USERNAME=mmuser
    - MM_PASSWORD=mmuser-password
    - MM_DBNAME=mattermost
    - VIRTUAL_HOST=mymattermost.tld
  expose:
    - "80"
    - "443"

Why does NGINX fail when installing Gitlab CE with Mattermost on Azure?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may need to update the Callback URLs for the Application entry of Mattermost inside your GitLab instance.

1. Log in to your GitLab instance as the admin.
2. Go to **Admin > Applications**.
3. Select **Edit** on GitLab-Mattermost.
4. Update the callback URLs to your new domain/URL.
5. Save the changes.
6. Update the external URL for GitLab and Mattermost in the ``/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`` configuration file.

Why does Certbot fail the http-01 challenge?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

  Requesting a certificate for yourdomain.com
  Performing the following challenges:
  http-01 challenge for yourdomain.com
  Waiting for verification...
  Challenge failed for domain yourdomain.com
  http-01 challenge for yourdomain.com
  Cleaning up challenges
  Some challenges have failed.
   
If you see the above errors this is typically because Certbot wasn't able to access port 80. This can be due to a firewall or other DNS configuration. Make sure that your A/AAAA records are pointing to this server and your ``server_name`` within the NGINX config doesn't have a redirect.

.. note::
   If you're using Cloudflare you'll need to disable ``force traffic to https``.

Certbot rate limiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're running certbot as stand-alone you'll see this error:

.. code-block:: none

      Error: Could not issue a Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate for example.com.
      One of the Let's Encrypt rate limits has been exceeded for example.com.
      See the related Knowledge Base article for details.
      Details
      Invalid response from https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/new-order.
      Details:
      Type: urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited
      Status: 429
      Detail: Error creating new order :: too many failed authorizations recently: see https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

If you're running Let's Encrypt within Mattermost you'll see this error:

.. code-block:: none

    {"level":"error","ts":1609092001.752515,"caller":"http/server.go:3088","msg":"http: TLS handshake error from ip:port: 429 urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited: Error creating new order :: too many failed authorizations recently: see https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/","source":"httpserver"}

This means that you've attempted to generate a cert too many times. You can find more information `here <https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits>`_.
