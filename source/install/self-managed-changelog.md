[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) is an open source platform for secure collaboration across the entire software development lifecycle. This changelog summarizes updates for the latest self-hosted versions of Mattermost.

See the [changelog in progress](https://bit.ly/2nK3cVf) for the upcoming release. See the [Legacy Self-Hosted Mattermost Changelog](legacy-self-hosted-changelog) for details on all Mattermost self-hosted releases prior to v5.37. 

## Latest Mattermost releases
- [Release v6.2 - Feature Release](#release-v6.2-feature-release)
- [Release v6.1 - Feature Release](#release-v6.1-feature-release)

## Release v6.2 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v6.2.1, released 2021-12-17**
  - Mattermost v6.2.1 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - Fixed an issue where a SIGSEGV error occurred after upgrading to v6.2.0 when plugins were disabled in configuration.
- **v6.2.0, released 2021-12-16**
  - Mattermost v6.2.0 contains low to medium level security fixes. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 -  Channel results in the channel autocomplete will include private channels. Customers using [Bleve](https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/bleve-search.html) or [Elasticsearch](https://docs.mattermost.com/scale/elasticsearch.html) for autocomplete will have to reindex their data to get the new results. Since this can take a long time, we suggest disabling autocomplete and running indexing in the background. When this is complete, re-enable autocomplete. Note that only channel members will see private channel names in autocomplete results.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.1, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

## Release v6.1 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v6.1.1, released 2021-12-17**
  - Mattermost v6.1.1 contains medium level security fixes. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - Added a general performance fix for loading the web application and typing.
  - Improved performance while typing by moving some autocomplete layout calculations.
  - Improved performance by reducing DOM usage during render.
  - Removed real-time updates of a couple of features to prevent overloading servers on user updates. The "This channel contains guests" indicator and the number of timezones displayed when notifying members of a group will only be updated on channel change now.
  - Fixed slow channel loading for instances with website link previews enabled.
  - Fixed an issue with Focalboard where an empty white screen appeared in Mattermost desktop app on reload.
  - Fixed an issue where v6.1 reported an incorrect mmctl version.
- **v6.1, released 2021-11-16**
  - Mattermost v6.1.0 contains low level security fixes. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Please refer to [the schema migration analysis](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/997b726a86b5d2a624ac2af435a66086) when upgrading to v6.1.
 - The Bleve index has been updated to use the scorch index type. This new default index type features some efficiency improvements which means that the indexes use significantly less disk space. To use this new type of index, after upgrading the server version, run a purge operation and then a reindex from the Bleve section of the System Console. Bleve is still compatible with the old indexes, so the currently indexed data will work fine if the purge and reindex is not run.
 - A composite index has been added to the jobs table for better query performance. For some customers with a large jobs table, this can take a long time, so we recommend adding the index during off-hours, and then running the migration. A table with more than 1 million rows can be considered as large enough to be updated prior to the upgrade.
   - For PostgreSQL: ``create index concurrently idx_jobs_status_type on jobs (status,type);``
   - For MySQL: ``create index idx_jobs_status_type on Jobs (Status,Type);``

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.0, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Deprecations

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/command-line-tools.html). Most commands have been replaced by [mmctl](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a robust replacement.

2. [Slack Import via the web app](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu has been replaced by the [mmetl](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.12. Minimum support is now for 5.7.12+. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 is Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We no longer provide support for Mattermost Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFAEndpoint](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting. The config setting is removed and the feature is promoted to general availability.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The deprecated settings include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - Longer migration times can be expected. See [this document](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/59b3582118913d4fc5e8ff81ea78b055) for the estimated upgrade times with datasets of 10+ million posts. See [this document](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/868c451164f6e8069d8b398685a31b6e) for the estimated upgrade times with datasets of 70+ million posts. The field type of Data in model.ClusterMessage was changed to []byte from string. Therefore, a major thing to note is that a v6 server is incompatible to run along with a v5 server in a cluster. Customers upgrading from 5.x to 6.x cannot do a High Availability upgrade. While upgrading, it is required that no other v5 server runs when a v6 server is brought up. A v6 server will run significant database schema changes that can cause a large startup time depending on the dataset size. Zero downtime will not be possible, but depending on the efforts made during the migration process, it can be minimized to a large extent. It is recommended to start Mattermost directly and not through systemctl to avoid the server process getting killed during the migration. This can happen since the value of ``TimeoutStartSec`` in the provided systemctl service file is set to 1 hour. Customers using the Mattermost Kubernetes operator should be aware of the above migration information and choose the path that is most appropriate for them. If (1) is acceptable, then the normal upgrade process using the operator will suffice. For minimum downtime, follow (2) before using the operator to update Mattermost following the normal upgrade process.
   1. Low effort, long downtime - This is the usual process of starting a v6 server normally. This has 2 implications: during the migration process, various tables will be locked which will render those tables read-only during that period. Secondly, once the server finishes migration and starts the application, no other v5 server can run in the cluster.
   2. Medium effort, medium downtime - This process will require SQL queries to be executed manually on the server. To avoid causing a table lock, a customer can choose to use the pt-online-schema-change tool for MySQL. For Postgres, the table locking is very minimal. The advantage is that since there are a lot of queries, the customer can take their own time to run individual queries during off-hours. All queries except #11 are safe to be executed this way. Then the usual method of (1) can be followed.
   3. High effort, low downtime - This process requires everything of (2), plus it tries to minimize the impact of query #11. We can do this by following step 2, and then starting v6 along with a running v5 server, and then monitor the application logs. As soon as the v6 application starts up, we need to bring down a v5 node. This minimizes the downtime to only a few seconds.
 - Focalboard plugin has been renamed to Mattermost Boards, and v0.9.1 (released with Mattermost v6.0) is now enabled by default.
 - The advanced logging configuration schema changed. This is a breaking change relative to 5.x. See updated [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/audit-log.html).
 - Some breaking changes to plugins are included:
   - Support for left-hand side-specific bot icons was dropped.
   - Removed a deprecated "Backend" field from the plugin manifest.
   - Converted the "Executables" field in the plugin manifest to a map.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.39, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Multi-Product Platform
 - Mattermost now ships as one platform with three products - Channels, Playbooks, and Boards.
 - Playbooks and Boards are visible when [plugins are enabled system-wide](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-plugins). 

#### Global Product Launcher
 - Added a global header for product navigation for Channels, Playbooks, and Boards. This is disabled on the mobile web view and mobile apps.

#### Branding Changes
 - Added a new default brand theme named "Denim".
 - The existing theme names and colors, including "Mattermost", "Organization", "Mattermost Dark", and "Windows Dark" have been updated to the new "Denim", "Sapphire", "Quartz", "Indigo", and "Onyx" theme names and colors, respectively. Anyone using the existing themes will see slightly modified theme colors after their server or workspace is upgraded. The theme variables for the existing "Mattermost", "Organization", "Mattermost Dark", and "Windows Dark" themes will still be accessible in [our documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/customizing-theme-colors.html#custom-theme-examples), so a custom theme can be created with these theme variables if desired. Custom themes are unaffected by this change.
 - Added a new light theme named "Quartz" to the default available list of themes.
 - Updated email templates to the new branding.

#### Packaging Changes
 - Updated in-product strings referencing E10 & E20 to [new packaging](https://mattermost.com/pricing).
 - Features moved from legacy E10 to all plans, including Team Edition:
   - System default permissions, e.g. permission to create and archive channels system-wide.
      - Specifically, “System Scheme” only in **System Console > User Management > Permissions**. 
      - Existing permissions/policies in TE/E0 for "Enable Team Creation" and "Allow Team Administrators to edit others’ posts" are properly handled. 
   - Team and Channel management pages (but without channel moderation, e.g. read-only channels).
 - Features moved from legacy E20 to Professional plan:
   - SSO with OpenID Connect, SAML, Google and O365
   - O365 integrations including MS Teams Calling and MS Calendar
   - Jira multi-server support
   - Advanced team permissions
   - Channel moderation
 - E20, Professional, and Enterprise license SKUs are now supported for installing Enterprise plugins.

#### Beta features Promoted to General Availability
   - Archived channels
   - Compliance exports
   - Custom terms of service
   - Guest accounts
   - System roles
   - Plugins

#### Permalink Previews
 - Added support for permalink previews for posts in Mattermost. Previews are generated to minimize context switching when sharing message links in Channels.

#### Tutorial Updates
 - Added a tip to the **Getting Started** page for downloading Desktop Apps.
 - Updated tutorial icons and changed text content in tutorial tips.
 - Updated the default treatment for the ``Add channel`` button to the current color and by team name.
 - Added a tutorial tip for new settings and status buttons.
 - Added a tip for the product switcher. This tip is skipped if not applicable.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added “Invite People” to the main "+" button below the hamburger menu.
 - The whole category bounds are now highlighted while holding a channel above a category name on the left-hand side.
 - Updated **Account Settings > Display > Timezone** to be more user friendly.
 - New theme agnostic file preview modal takes up the full screen. The file preview now has information about the user, channel, and the file, and moves away from text-based buttons to icon-based buttons.
 - Increased the limit of uploaded file attachments per post from 5 to 10.
 - Added desktop notifications for followed Threads.
 - Hungarian and English-Australian are now official languages.
 - Added a **Start Trial** call-to action to the **Main Menu**.
 - Changed H1-H3 heading font from Open Sans to Metropolis.

#### Performance
 - Improved typing performance when the emoji autocomplete is open.
 - Added performance improvements for draft storage with multiple tabs open.
 - Improved performance of draft loading.

#### Integrations
 - Pre-packaged Channel Export plugin v1.0.0.
 - Added a "rest field" to the App command parser.
 - Added support for React components in channel header tooltips registered by plugins.
 - Exported ``ChannelInviteModal`` and ``ChannelMembersModal`` components for plugins.

#### Administration
 - Added ``playbooks`` and ``boards`` to restricted team URLs list. Conflict exists if users hit the URL to the team directly without the trailing channel, permalink or threads information (ie server/team) and they have a team name “playbooks” or “boards”. User would expect to be taken to their messaging team.  
 - Added the ability for Team Edition to edit role permissions.
 - Removed a hard-coded override of ``TeamSettings.MaxNotificationsPerChannel`` on unlicensed servers (e.g. Team Edition).
 - Migrated the extraction command to mmctl.
 - Removed the convert channel endpoint to use ``/channels/{channel_id}/privacy`` instead.
 - Removed deprecated ``Posts.ParentId`` in favor of the semantically equivalent ``Posts.RootId``. Also removed ``CommandWebhook.ParentId`` and ``CompliancePost.ParentId`` for the same reason.
 - Removed the following deprecated CLI commands in favor of [mmctl](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html):
   - channel
   - command
   - config
   - extract
   - group
   - integrity
   - ldap
   - license
   - logs
   - permissions
   - plugin
   - reset
   - roles
   - sampledata
   - team
   - user
   - webhook

### Bug Fixes

 - Disabled admin support email status check job on server startup.
 - Fixed an issue on joining a missing channel as a System Admin.

### Database Changes
 - Added the following database indexes:
   - ``idx_posts_root_id_delete_at_create_at``
   - ``idx_channels_team_id_display_name``
   - ``idx_channels_team_id_type``
   - ``idx_threads_channel_id_last_reply_at``
   - ``idx_channelmembers_user_id_channel_id_last_viewed_at``
   - ``idx_channelmembers_channel_id_scheme_guest_user_id``

This makes the threads API consistent with other endpoints, and automatically limits the number of requested threads with our param handling code. The ``pageSize`` query parameter will still be supported until version 6.0 of the server becomes the minimum version required by the mobile client.

### Websocket Event Changes

   - ``model.ChannelListWithTeamData``
   - ``model.ChannelMembers``
   - ``model.Preferences``
   - ``model.ProductNotices``
 - Renamed ``plugin.Context.IpAddress`` to ``plugin.Context.IPAddress``.
 - Renamed fields in the model package to have more idiomatic names.

### Go Version
 - v6.0 is built with Go ``v1.16.7``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``@mattermost/compass-components``, ``@mattermost/compass-icons``, ``styled-components`` and ``timezones.json``, and removed ``react-inlinesvg`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.
 - Added ``@types/redux-mock-store`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile.

### Go Version
 - v5.39 is built with Go ``1.16.7``.

### Upcoming Deprecations in Mattermost v6.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v6.0 release, which is scheduled for 2021/10/13. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/command-line-tools.html). All commands have been fully replaced by [mmctl](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a full and robust replacement. 

2. [Slack Import via the web app](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu is being replaced by the [mmetl](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.7. Minimum support will now be for 5.7.12. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 will be Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We will no longer provide support for Mattermost Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFAEndpoint](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting. The config setting will be removed and the feature will be promoted to general availability.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The settings being deprecated include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

## Release v5.38 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v5.38.4, released 2021-11-15**
  - Mattermost v5.38.4 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
- **v5.38.3, released 2021-10-27**
  - Mattermost v5.38.3 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - Fixed a race condition in telemetry IDs on High Availability servers [MM-39343](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-39343).
- **v5.38.2, released 2021-08-26**
  - Upgraded Go version to 1.16.7 to fix an application crash issue.
  - Fixed an issue where mmctl ``config reload`` command was missing local-mode server-side implementation. [MM-38082](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38082)
- **v5.38.1, released 2021-08-18**
  - Fixed an issue where Playbooks v1.16.0 could not be installed as a pre-packaged plugin [MM-37928](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-37928).
- **v5.38.0, released 2021-08-16**
  - Original 5.38.0 release

Mattermost v5.38.0 contains low to medium level security fixes. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Deprecations
 - The “config watcher” (the mechanism that automatically reloads the ``config.json`` file) has been removed in favor of the ``mmctl config reload`` command, which must be run to apply configuration changes after they are made on disk. This change improves configuration performance and robustness.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - v5.38 adds fixes for some of the incorrect mention counts and unreads around threads and channels since the introduction of Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta). This fix is done through a SQL migration, and it may take several minutes to complete for large databases. The ``fixCRTChannelMembershipCounts`` fix takes 1 minute and 20 seconds for a database containing approximately 4 million channel memberships and about 130,000 channels. The ``fixCRTThreadCountsAndUnreads`` fix takes about 3 minutes and 30 seconds for a database containing 56367 threads, 124587 thread memberships, and 220801 channel memberships. These are on MySQL v5.6.51.
 - Focalboard v0.8.2 (released with Mattermost v5.38.0) requires Mattermost v5.37+ due to the new database connection system.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.37, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Granular Data Retention Policies (Enterprise E20)
 - A ``data_retention`` type job can now be run even if the global policy is disabled. The granular (i.e. team and channel-specific) policies will be executed when the data retention job is run. Please note there is a known issue where deleted posts get displayed in channels without new activity after the retention job is run.  This issue is tracked with [this ticket](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-36574).

#### Enhanced User Onboarding Experience
 - To help new users get started with Mattermost, new Getting Started steps have been added to the onboarding experience. These steps help users to complete their profile, name their teams, configure desktop notifications, and invite others to join their team. Additionally, once the onboarding is complete, users are provided with helpful tips to get started with channels, plugins, and more.

#### Playbooks Updates
 - ``Incident Collaboration`` was rebranded to ``Playbooks``. Also the channel right-hand sidebar is redesigned, our own playbooks are shared as templates, and more triggers and actions were added.

#### Focalboard Updates
 - Added created-by property and improved performance with shared database connections. Focalboard 0.8.2 requires Mattermost v5.37+ due to a new database connection system.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Upgraded German language back to an official language.
 - Markdown formatting is now stripped from push notifications.
 - Enabled the **Set Status** button if the custom status hasn't changed from currently set status.
 - Improved default rendering of images inserted via the GIF picker.
 - Small text changes were added to Direct and Group Message menus: **Mute channel** and **Edit Channel Header** now reads as **Mute Conversation** and **Edit Conversation Header**.

#### Performance
 - Improved performance of components that show reactions on posts.
 - Improved performance of certain components when viewing non-Direct Message channels.
 - Added minor improvements to performance of messages posted in the right-hand side.
 - Improved typing performance in affected environments by reducing the frequency in which drafts are saved.

#### Integrations
 - Added icons to apps in the Marketplace.
 - Apps can now add arbitrary markdown in between fields on forms.
 - Added support for markdown in apps forms, interactive dialogs field descriptions, errors, and slash commands.
 - Improved user and channel selector for app commands.
 - Added support for ``react-intl`` and ``<Timestamp/>`` usage in plugins.
 - Added plugin API methods for user access tokens and OAuth apps.

#### Administration
 - Added a new feature to archive and unarchive teams through **System Console** > **Teams**.

 - Fixed an issue where inter-plugin requests without a body didn't work.
 - Fixed an issue with opening a dialog from an interactive message when returning an empty response.

 - Fixed various bugs for the Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta) feature, including:
   - Fixed an issue where an error occurred while following a thread with no replies.
   - Fixed an issue where ``reply_count`` of 0 was always returned for GET single Post on ``/posts/<postid>`` API.
   - Fixed an issue where following a single message returned a status 500.
   - Fixed an issue where when replying in a thread after unfollowing it, the thread was not auto-followed again.
   - Fixed an issue where when enabling Collapsed Reply Threads, channels that had no new activity were showing as unread.
   - Fixed an issue with thread unreads when the feature was enabled by a user.
   - Fixed an issue where self replies were marking threads as unread.
   - Unread threads are now correctly displayed on app load for teams in the sidebar when Collapsed Reply Threads feature is enabled.
   - Fixed an issue where "Thread" in the thread viewer was displayed vertically in some languages.
   - Fixed an issue where opening global threads containing a root post markdown image crashed the app.
   - Fixed an issue where the app crashed when switching to the Threads view after leaving a channel.
   - Fixed an issue where replying to a thread from the global threads screen marked the channel as read.
   - The **Mark all as unread** button is now no longer disabled for Collapsed Reply Threads.
   - Fixed root posts not being shown as followed for the post creator after receiving the first reply that affected servers with Collapsed Reply Threads enabled and database read replicas configured.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``PluginSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``ChimeraOAuthProxyURL`` to allow specifying Chimera URL that can be used by plugins to connect with pre-created OAuth applications.
 - The config setting ``EnableReliableWebSockets`` now defaults to ``true``.

### API Changes
 - Added ``CreateChannelSidebarCategory``, ``GetChannelSidebarCategories`` and ``UpdateChannelSidebarCategories`` to the Plugin API.
 - Add a new Plugin API method that allows files to register dropdown menu actions.

### Go Version
 - v5.38 is built with Go ``1.16.0``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``classnames`` and ``react-window`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/.
 - Added ``@react-native-community/datetimepicker``, ``array.prototype.flat``, and ``base-64`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/.

### Upcoming Deprecations in Mattermost v6.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v6.0 release, which is scheduled for 2021/10/15. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/command-line-tools.html). All commands have been fully replaced by [mmctl](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a full and robust replacement. 

2. [Slack Import via the web app](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu is being replaced by the [mmetl](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.7. Minimum support will now be for 5.7.12. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 will be Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We will no longer provide support for Mattermost Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFA](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The settings being deprecated include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

### Known Issues

### Deprecations
 - The ``platform`` binary and “--platform” flag have been removed. If you are using the “--platform” flag or are using the ``platform`` binary directly to run the Mattermost server application via a systemd file or custom script, you will be required to use only the mattermost binary.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-beta/) are available as beta in Mattermost Server v5.37 and later. It’s expected that you may experience bugs as we stabilize the feature. In particular, please be aware of [the known issues documented here](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues).
 - v5.37 adds support for emoji standard v13.0. If you have added a custom emoji in the past that uses one of the new system names, then that custom emoji is going to get overwritten by the system emoji. The workaround is to change the custom emoji name.
 - Parts of Incident Collaboration are now available to all Mattermost editions. As part of this update, Incident Collaboration will require a minimum server version of v5.37. To learn more about what is available in each edition, visit [our pricing page](https://mattermost.com/pricing-self-managed/).
 - Support for Mattermost Server v5.31 [Extended Support Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html) will come to the end of its life cycle on October 15, 2021. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v5.37 or later is required.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.36, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta)
 - We're excited to give you early access to Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta). It can be enabled in the **System Console > Experimental > Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta)**. Learn more about the features and known issues in [our documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/organizing-conversations.html).

#### Emoji Enhancements with Skin Tone Selection
 - Added support for emoji standard v13.0. Users now have the ability to choose various skin tones using the Mattermost emoji picker. Mobile support is included in v1.45 Mobile App release (July 16th).

#### Improved Enterprise Trial Experience (Enterprise Editions E0, E10, E20)
 - After a Self-Managed trial ends, admins can optionally contact sales or make a purchase in a single click.

#### Focalboard: Grouped Table view, New properties, and More (Beta)
 - Focalboard tables can now be grouped by a property, for example allowing you to quickly see tasks per epic or owner.

#### Incident Collaboration Updates
 - The update includes availability on all editions, playbook keyword monitoring, retrospective report, and playbook dashboard.

#### English-Australian Language Support

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - In the at-mention autocomplete, the user’s nickname is no longer shown when (you) is present.
 - Updated the help text on the **Add Users** channel modal.
 - Added the ability to upload ``.jpeg`` files on Linux. Uploading ``.jpg`` files was already supported.
 - The **Channel Switcher** now displays recently viewed channels when launched.
 - Polish, German, and Italian languages were downgraded to beta as they are [no longer actively maintained](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/localization#translation-quality).
 - Custom statuses can now be set to expire after common time intervals or custom selected dates and times. Mobile App support will be added in a future release.

#### Performance

#### Administration
 - Improved memory performance for large image uploads, particularly PNGs with transparency.
 - Optimized the bulk import process by no longer requiring the server to write the incoming archive to the filesystem when unzipping it.
 - Added channel restore and channel privacy change endpoints to the local mode using the System bot.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue where messages with fallback text were repeated.
 - Fixed an issue where a persistent unread badge showed on the **Main Menu** when **Enable Marketplace** or **Enable Plugins** was disabled.
 - Fixed an issue where sidebar icons were not aligned with the navigator area icons.
 - Fixed an issue where using CTRL+F in a **Direct Message** channel added the user ID rather than the user's name into the search field.
 - Fixed an issue where user icons were displayed at full opacity in muted channels.
 - Fixed an issue where a redundant ``user_update`` websocket event was generated for bot users.
 - Fixed an issue where a Self-Managed Enterprise Edition E20 trial could be activated more than once without contacting the Mattermost support team.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

 - Added two new fields in ``CustomStatus`` struct and modified the APIs to validate and handle them.

### Go Version
 - v5.37 is built with Go ``1.15.5``.

### Open Source Components
 - Removed ``reselect`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/.

### Upcoming Deprecations in Mattermost v6.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v6.0 release, which is scheduled for 2021/10/15. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/command-line-tools.html). All commands have been fully replaced by [mmctl](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a full and robust replacement. 

2. [Slack Import via the web app](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/migrating.html?highlight=mmetl#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu is being replaced by the [mmetl](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/migrating.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.7. Minimum support will now be for 5.7.12. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 will be Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We will no longer provide support for the Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFA](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The settings being deprecated include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

### Known Issues
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) is currently in beta. Before enabling the feature, please ensure you are well versed in the [known issues](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues),  particularly relating to database resource requirements and server performance implications. If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it is [promoted to general availability in Q1 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga/). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).

 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
