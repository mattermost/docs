### Go Version
 - v8.1 is built with Go ``v1.19.5``.

### Known Issues
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - Insights has been deprecated for all new instances and for existing servers that upgrade to v8.0. See more details in [this forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/proposal-to-revise-our-insights-feature-due-to-known-performance-issues/16212) on why Insights has been deprecated.
 - The Focalboard plugin is now disabled by default for all new instances and can be enabled in the **System Console > Plugin settings**.
 - The Channel Export and Apps plugins are now disabled by default.
 - Apps Bar is now enabled by default for on-prem servers. ``ExperimentalSettings.EnableAppBar`` was also renamed to ``ExperimentalSettings.DisableAppBar``. See more details at:
   - https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/experimental-configuration-settings.html#disable-app-bar 
   - https://forum.mattermost.com/t/channel-header-plugin-changes/13551
 - Introduced the [public](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/public) submodule, housing the familiar `model` and `plugin` packages, but now discretely versioned from the server. It is no longer necessary to `go get` a particular commit hash, as Go programs and plugins can now opt-in to importing `github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/public` and managing versions idiomatically. While this submodule has not yet shipped a v1 and will introduce breaking changes before stabilizing the API, it remains both forwards and backwards compatible with the Mattermost server itself.
 - In the main `server package`, the Go module path has changed from ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/v8`` to ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8``. But with the introduction of the `public` submodule, it should no longer be necessary for third-party code to import this `server` package.
 - As part of the `public` submodule above, a ``context.Context`` is now passed to ``model.Client4`` methods.
 - Removed support for PostgreSQL v10. The new minimum PostgreSQL version is now v11.
 - The Mattermost public API for Go is now available as a distinctly versioned package. Instead of pinning a particular commit hash, use idiomatic Go to add this package as a dependency: go get ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/public``. This relocated Go API maintains backwards compatibility with Mattermost v7. Furthermore, the existing Go API previously at github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/v6/model remains forward compatible with Mattermost v8, but may not contain newer features. Plugins do not need to be recompiled, but developers may opt in to using the new package to simplify their build process. The new public package is shipping alongside Mattermost v8 as version 0.5.0 to allow for some additional code refactoring before releasing as v1 later this year.
 - Three configuration fields have been added, ``LogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, ``ExperimentalAuditSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, and ``NotificationLogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON`` which support multi-line JSON, escaped JSON as a string, or a filename that points to a file containing JSON.  The ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` fields have been deprecated.
 - The Go MySQL driver has changed the ``maxAllowedPacket`` size from 4MiB to 64MiB. This is to make it consistent with the change in the server side default value from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. If your ``max_allowed_packet`` setting is not 64MiB, then please update the MySQL config DSN with an additional param of ``maxAllowedPacket`` to match with the server side value. Alternatively, a value of 0 can be set to to automatically fetch the server side value, on every new connection, which has a performance overhead.
 - Removed ``ExperimentalSettings.PatchPluginsReactDOM``. If this setting was previously enabled, confirm that:

    1. All Mattermost-supported plugins are updated to the latest versions.
    2. Any other plugins have been updated to support React 17. See the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html) for v7.7 for more information.

 - Removed deprecated ``PermissionUseSlashCommands``.
 - Removed deprecated ``model.CommandArgs.Session``.
 - Pass a ``context.Context`` to Client4 methods.
 - For servers wanting to allow websockets to connect from origins other than the origin of the site URL, please set the ``ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom`` [configuration setting](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/integrations-configuration-settings.html#enable-cross-origin-requests-from). Also ensure that the ``siteURL`` is set correctly.
 - In v8.0, the following repositories are merged into one: ``mattermost-server``, ``mattermost-webapp`` and ``mmctl``. Developers should read the updated [Developer Guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/developer-setup/) for details.
 - Fixed an issue caused by a migration in the previous release. Query takes around 11ms on a PostgreSQL 14 DB t3.medium RDS instance. Locks on the preferences table will only be acquired if there are rows to delete, but the time taken is negligible.
 - Fixed an issue where a user would still see threads in the threads view of channels they have left. Migration execution time in PostgreSQL: Execution time: 58.11 sec, DELETE 2766690. Migration execution time in MySQL: Query OK, 2766769 rows affected (4 min 47.57 sec).
 - The file info stats query is now optimized by denormalizing the ``channelID`` column into the table itself. This will speed up the query to get the file count for a channel when selecting the right-hand pane. Migration times:

   - On a PostgreSQL 12.14 DB with 1731 rows in FileInfo and 11M posts, it took around 0.27s
   - On a MySQL 8.0.31 DB with 1405 rows in FileInfo and 11M posts, it took around 0.3s

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.10, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

   - https://forum.mattermost.com/t/channel-header-plugin-changes/13551
 - Added a **Mattermost Marketplace** option to the bottom of the apps bar. The option is visible when the Marketplace is enabled, and the user has ``SYSCONSOLE_WRITE_PLUGINS`` permissions.
 - Calls v0.17.0 introduces a new ringing feature (Beta): Calls in Direct and Group Message channels will ring and pop up a visual notification for the incoming call. Check out the Calls v0.17.0 release notes and [Calls documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/make-calls.html) for more details.

#### Administration
 - Added a new ``ConfigurationWillBeSaved`` plugin hook which is invoked before the configuration object is committed to the backing store.
 - Admins can now specify index names to ignore while purging indexes from Elasticsearch with the ``ElasticsearchSettings.IgnoredPurgeIndexes`` setting.
 - Added an option to use the German HPNS notification proxy.
 - New flags were added to the [database migrate command](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-db-migrate) as following:

    - ``auto-recover``: If the migration plan receives an error during migrations, this command will try to rollback migrations already applied within the plan. This option is not recommended to be added without reviewing migration plan. You can review the plan by combining ``--save-plan`` and ``--dry-run`` flags.
    - ``save-plan``: The plan for the migration will be saved into the file store so that it can be used for reviewing the plan or to be used for downgrading.
    - ``dry-run``: Does not apply the migrations, but it validates how the migration would run with the given conditions.

 - A new [database subcommand](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-db-downgrade) "downgrade" was added to be able to rollback database migrations. The command either requires an update plan to rollback, or comma separated version numbers.
 - Removed ``/api/v4/users/stats`` network request from ``InviteMembersButton``.
 - Self-hosted admins can now define a separate shipping address during in-product license purchase.
 - Added updates to the trial request forms to allow for a more tailored trial experience.

 - **Contact Support** now redirects users to Zendesk and pre-fills known information.
 - Added a mechanism for public routes on products and used it to support publicly shared Board links.
 - The database section in the **System Console** now has an additional read-only section which shows the active search backend in use. This can be helpful to confirm which search engine is currently active when there are multiple configured.
 - Updated Docker Base Image from Debian to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
 - Type-generated settings will now be generated (only for future generations) with a URL-safe version of base64 encoding.
 - Mattermost is now resilient against database replica outages and will dynamically choose a replica if it's alive. Also a config parameter ``ReplicaMonitorIntervalSeconds`` was added and the default value is 5. This controls how frequently unhealthy replicas will be monitored for liveness check.
 
#### Performance
 - Improved the performance of webapp related to timezone calculations.
 - Improved performance of code used for post list screen reader support.

### API Changes
 - An underscore is now used in the timeline API (``event-id`` -> ``event_id``) for consistency with other API arguments.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed a scrolling issue in the purchase modals.
 - Fixed an issue where the experimental Shared Channels feature failed to synchronize if a previously removed table column was still present.
 - Fixed an issue where clicking on a channel link (for a channel the user was not a part of) caused the webapp to refresh, dropping the user from a call.
 - Fixed an issue with PDF preview rendering for certain Japanese characters.
 - Fixed an issue where the screen reader did not announce the action of copying the link in the invite modal.
 - Fixed an issue with post metadata not generating correctly for images due to missing content-type in response. This would result in certain embedded images not to display on mobile clients.
 - Fixed an issue where edits to messages persisted after canceling.
 - Added a condition for bot tags for webhook posts when a bot account is used for webhooks.
 - Fixed the sorting value of categories in ``CreateSidebarCategoryForTeamForUser``.
 - Fixed a potential crash when opening the user profile popover.
 - Fixed permalink and thread reply navigation between teams.
 - Fixed an issue with the installation of pre-packaged plugins that are not in the Marketplace.
 - Fixed an issue caused by a migration in a previous release. The query takes around 11ms on a PostgreSQL 14 DB t3.medium RDS instance. Locks on the preferences table will only be acquired if there are rows to delete, but the time taken is negligible.
 - Fixed an issue where modals did not close when clicking below them on certain screen sizes.
 - Fixed an issue with a few translation labels that couldn't be translated.
 - Fixed an issue where the server log UI for plain text formatting was unexpectedly removed in a previous release.
 - Fixed an issue where combined system messages did not display in chronological order.
 - Fixed an issue where the current user and status were not updated on WebSocket reconnect.
 - Fixed an issue where certain hashtags were not searchable when using database search.
 - Fixed the **New Messages** line overlapping date lines in the post list.
 - Fixed an issue where post reactions disappeared when the search sidebar was open.
 - Fixed an issue with broken "medical_symbol", "male_sign", and "female_sign" emojis.
 - Fixed a panic where a JSON null value was passed as a channel update.
 - Fixed an issue where the draft counter badge remained in cases where a deleted parent post was removed.
 - Fixed an issue where posts were not fully sanitized for audit output when a link preview was included.
 - Fixed an issue where the footer with **Save/Cancel** buttons did not get anchored properly in the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue where the undo history was erased when links, tables, or code was pasted into the textbox.
 - Fixed an issue where Elasticsearch didn't properly start on startup when enabled. Also added a missing ``IsEnabled`` method to Elasticsearch.
 - Fixed an issue where text couldn't be copied from the post textbox.
 - Fixed an issue where using **SHIFT+TAB** with a screen reader placed the cursor focus at the bottom of the channel rather than at the post that was linked to.
 
### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to all plans:
 - Removed ``EnableInactivityEmail`` config setting.
 - Added a new config setting section ``ProductSettings``.
 - Under ``ExperimentalSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``DelayChannelAutocomplete``, to make the channel autocomplete only appear after typing a couple letters instead of immediately after a tilde.
   - Added ``DisableRefetchingOnBrowserFocus``, to disable re-fetching of channel and channel members on browser focus.
   - Added ``DisableAppBar`` to enable apps bar by default.
 - Three configuration fields have been added, ``LogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, ``ExperimentalAuditSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, and ``NotificationLogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON`` which support multi-line JSON, escaped JSON as a string, or a filename that points to a file containing JSON.  The ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` fields have been deprecated.

#### Changes to Professional and Enterprise plans:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added new configuration settings ``AllowPersistentNotifications``, ``PersistentNotificationIntervalMinutes``, ``PersistentNotificationMaxCount``, ``PersistentNotificationMaxRecipients``, to add a persistent notification option when sending urgent priority posts.

#### Changes to Enterprise plan:
 - Under ``ElasticsearchSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Now you can specify index names to ignore while purging indexes from Elasticsearch with the ``IgnoredPurgeIndexes`` setting.

### Go Version
 - v8.0 is built with Go ``v1.19.5``.

### Open Source Components:
 - Added ``date-fns`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/.

### Known Issues
 - White screen might appear when creating a slash command [MM-53665](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53665).
 - When sending a draft message in a Thread, the message is not cleared if the thread is open in the right-hand side [MM-53520](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53520).
 - Channel and team names are missing from **Saved Posts** in the right-hand side [MM-53636](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53636).
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - In the next release, v7.11, the following repositories will be merged into one: ``mattermost-server``, ``mattermost-webapp``, ``focalboard`` and ``mattermost-plugin-playbooks``. Developers should read the updated [Developer Guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/developer-setup/) for details. **Playbooks and Boards will be core parts of the product that cannot be disabled**.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.9, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added the ability to set a reminder to read a message at a specific time via the **More** menu in messages.
 - Mentions from muted channels are no longer shown or counted on the browser and desktop tabs.
 - Updated descriptions for **Environment > Developer** settings in the **System Console** to clarify that changes require a server restart to take effect.
 - The custom user status is now shown in the right-hand side **Members** pane and in **System Console > Users**.
 - Added the ability to invite multiple people at a time by email to a Mattermost instance.
 - Added accessibility support to the date picker.
 - System admins are prompted to complete a feedback survey during a workspace downgrade process from Cloud Professional to Cloud Free.
 - Migrated the message (...) **More** option to a Material UI (MUI) menu.
 - Updated pre-packaged Boards to v7.10.0.
 - Updated pre-packaged Calls to v0.15.1.

#### Administration
 - The ``ServiceSettings.PostEditTimeLimit`` config setting no longer affects Plugins, Shared Channels, Integration Actions, or Mattermost Products.
 - The app server no longer starts if the telemetry ID in the systems table doesn't exist. Although there is no action required by the administrators, it may be good to be aware of this change. If the ID doesn't exist, administrators can read the error log and take action against it.
 - Added additional values to the support packet.
 - Self-hosted instances will now show invoices in **System Console > Billing & Account > Billing History*** for prior self-serve purchases.
 - A 404 error is now returned if an invoice could not be fetched for a self-hosted deployment.
 
#### Performance
 - Writes to websocket now take 13% less memory and happen 22% faster per message.

### API Changes
 - Added a ``exclude_files_count`` parameter to exclude file counts from channel stats API.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where Shared Channels wasn't properly added to the Professional license.
 - Fixed new teams to use the updated translation for default channels after a config change.
 - Fixed issues with spacing in the channel categories and maintained the same spacing in the left-hand side.
 - Fixed disproportionate height issues for tall single images.
 - Fixed an issue where a single WebSocket reconnect could be handled multiple times which would negatively affect performance.
 - Fixed an issue in **Top DM Insights**, where a deleted participant caused DM Insights to fail.
 - Fixed an issue where Cloud limits would briefly flash in the System Console before disappearing.
 - Fixed an issue with the compact message mode.
 
### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in the ``config.json``:
   - ``SelfHostedExpansion`` config setting was added to support incremental additions/changes to this feature.
 
### Go Version
 - v7.10 is built with Go ``v1.19.5``.
 
### Open Source Components
 - Added ``date-fns`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/.

### Known Issues
 - Updating from v7.9.x to Focalboard 7.10.4 causes Boards attachments to be lost [MM-53240](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53240).
 - Users have trouble logging into Mattermost mobile app when the DiagnosticId is not properly stored in cache after startup [MM-53195](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53195).
 - Users are unexpectedly forced to enable JSON logging [MM-51453](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-51453).
 - The new Insights feature has some performance costs that we are working to optimize. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``. See the `Insights </welcome/insights.html>`__ documentation for details.

 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.

 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards export and reimport results in duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.

### Important Upgrade Notes

- Added a new index on ``Posts(OriginalId)``. For a database with 11.8 million posts, on a machine with a i7-11800H CPU (8 cores, 16 threads), 32GiB of RAM and SSD, the index creation takes 98.51s on MYSQL and 2.6s on PostgreSQL. 
- In PostgreSQL databases, the ``Posts`` table will be locked during index creation. To avoid locking this table, admins can create the index manually before performing the upgrade using the following non-blocking query: ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_posts_original_id ON Posts(OriginalId);``. 
- Admins managing PostgreSQL deployments containing fewer posts may prefer that the migration process creates the index, and accept that ``Posts`` table will remain locked until the migration is complete.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.8, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Compatibility
 - Updated Firefox minimum supported version to 102+.
 - Updated Safari minimum supported version to 16.2+.
 - Updated Windows minimum supported version to 10+.
 - Updated Chromium minimum supported version to 110+.
 - Updated Edge minimum supported version to 110+.

### Highlights

#### Boards
 - System and team admins are now able to join any board on the team as a board admin via the board URL.
 - Additional Compliance APIs to return the history of boards and blocks, including deleted items (available in Mattermost Enterprise Edition and above).

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Prepackaged Calls v0.14.0.
 - All post components were removed in favor of a unified approach.
 - App bindings are now refreshed when a App plugin-enabled event gets triggered.
 - Improvements were added to the sidebar channel and category menus.
 - Removed right-click hijacking on code blocks in messages.
 - The order of the Leave Channel and Archive Channel settings were updated to match the mobile app.
 - Added the condition to remove unread styling for archived channels and to filter archived channels from local data.
 - Changed the collapsed post fade out effect to be less buggy.
 - Users now have the ability to see the history of edited messages and to restore an old message version with the current version.
 - Improved the user interface of the user profile popover.

#### Administration
 - Boards cards are no longer mentioned as being limited in the **System Console**, the limits usage modal, the downgrade modal, or the left-hand side menu.
 - Removed unused ``ProductLimits.Integrations``.
 - Export files now contain the read and unread status for channels.
 - Added an error message when running an LDAP sync with ``SyncEnabled`` set to ``false``.
 - Added Admin log table filtering and sorting.
 - GraphQL APIs are now correctly counted when measuring performance telemetry.
 - Added a dynamic call-to-action under **System Console > Site Statistics and > Team Statistics** for air-gapped and non-air-gapped systems. The banner reminding about true-up follows the schedule [outlined here](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/self-hosted-subscriptions.html#quarterly-true-up-report).
 - Screened self-hosted purchases now block the Admin from re-attempting a purchase for three days.

#### Performance
 - Reduced the rate that unreads are resynced when the window is focused from ten seconds to two minutes.
 - The center channel is no longer shown as loading when switching teams.
 - Added logging fixes: empty ``short_message`` for Gelf formatter is no longer allowed and ``params.Host`` is now used over ``params.IP`` for syslog config.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the System Console link to purchase a self-hosted license would get stuck showing the in-product purchase progress modal.
 - Fixed an issue where the true-up notification in the invite modal did not render the call-to-action correctly.
 - Fixed new teams to use the updated translation for default channels after a configuration change.
 - Fixed a layout issue in the System Console for smaller-sized tablets.
 - Fixed an issue where a "plugin configured with a nil SecureConfig" warning was logged when starting each plugin.
 - Fixed an issue where portal availability was checked when not on Enterprise edition.
 - Fixed an issue where C# syntax highlighting was not working.
 - Fixed an issue where incoming webhooks changed the user's activity while the user was offline/away.
 - Fixed an issue where usernames were not clickable in the right-hand side.

### API Changes
 - Added an ``exclude_files_count`` parameter to exclude file counts from the channel stats API.
 - Added a new API endpoint ``GET api/v4/posts/[POST_ID]/edit_history``.
 - Added a new API endpoint ``DELETE /api/v4/cloud/delete-workspace``.

### Database Changes
 - Added the ``SentAt`` column to ``NotifyAdmin``.
 - Updated ``NotifyAdmin.RequiredFeature`` column type to ``varchar(255)``.
 - Updated ``NotifyAdmin.RequiredPlan`` column type to ``varchar(100)``.

### Go Version
 - v7.9 is built with Go ``v1.19.0``.
 
### Open Source Components
 - Added ``@mui/base``, ``@mui/material`` and ``@mui/styled-engine-sc``, and removed ``form-data`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/.

### Known Issues
 - Users are unexpectedly forced to enable JSON logging [MM-51453](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-51453).
 - Checkmarks are missing from the left-hand side submenus [MM-51091](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-51091).
 - The new Insights feature has some performance costs that we are working to optimize. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``.
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards export and reimport results in duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar doesn't update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user isn't a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels, or remove those channels from the run configuration.

 - Added support for person property groups in Boards.
 - See [the docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/groups-filter-sort.html#work-with-groups-filter-and-sort) for more details.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)

 - Increased the character count for desktop notifications on Windows to 120 from 50.
 - Prioritized members of recently viewed direct or group messages when adding users to a channel.
 - Added support for multiple users and channels to the ``/invite`` slash command.

#### Administration
 - Self-hosted admins can now purchase licenses in-app when service setting ``SelfHostedPurchase`` is true.
 - Endpoint to portal added to detect whether a license is suitable for self-expansion. Customers over their seat limit can expand their license seats.
 - Airgapped purchase experience is now shown only when appropriate and a simplified authentication flow is now used for the self-hosted purchase.
 - The export file now contains the server version and a creation timestamp.
 - Total Activated Users was changed back to Total Active Users on the **System Console > Reporting > Site Statistics** page.
 - Added ``restore_group`` permission to the mmctl and to the **System Console > Permissions**.
 - Improved bulk export logging.
 - Compliance export jobs can now cancel the SQL query execution during server shutdown which will allow the job to exit faster.
 - The message export compliance job can now survive server restarts. The job will pause and save state when the server is shutting down, and resume from the previously saved state when the server starts back up.
 - Only one instance of the job will be automatically scheduled to run as per the ``MessageExportSettings.DailyRunTime`` config value.
 - Mattermost will throw an error if it detects an Elasticsearch version greater than 7.

    - ``wait_count_total``
    - ``wait_duration_seconds_total``

    - ``max_lifetime_closed_total``
 - Made the ``registerChannelIntroButtonAction`` plugin API usable by plugins other than Boards.
 - The following new HTTP headers and values are now written on all responses. These default values should make sense in most installations and can be overridden by a reverse proxy or ingress configuration. Note that the empty ``Permissions-Policy`` header does not have any actual effect. Users are recommended to change it to a more restrictive value based on their use case. For more information, see the [W3C Reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions-policy/) or [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy).

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - Plugins with a webapp component may need to be updated to work with Mattermost v7.7 release and the updated ``React v17`` dependency. 
 	- This is to avoid plugins crashing with an error about ``findDOMNode`` being called on an unmounted component. While our [starter template](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-starter-template) depended on an external version of ``React``, it did not do the same for ``ReactDOM``. Plugins need to update their ``webpack.config.js`` directives to externalize ``ReactDOM``. For reference, see https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/pull/1489. Server-side only plugins are unaffected. This change can be done for existing plugins any time prior to upgrading to Mattermost v7.7 and is backwards compatible with older versions of Mattermost. If you run into issues, you can either enable ``ExperimentalSettings.PatchPluginsReactDOM`` or just disable the affected plugin while it's updated.
 - Denormalized ``Threads`` table by adding the ``ThreadTeamId`` column. See details for schema changes in the [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).
 - Starting with the Calls version shipping with v7.7, there's now a minimum version requirement when using the external RTCD service. This means that if Calls is configured to use the external service, customers need to upgrade RTCD first to at least version 0.8.0 or the plugin will fail to start.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.5, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Compatibility
 - Updated the minimum version of MacOS to 11+.

### Highlights

#### Calls
 - [Audio calling and screen sharing](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/calls-deployment.html) in channels is now generally available to all Mattermost customers.
 - Updated [the keyboard shortcut](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/keyboard-shortcuts-for-channels.html#calls-shortcuts) to start and join calls.
 - Please see [the docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/plugins-configuration-settings.html#calls) for additional details on configuration setting updates.

#### Boards
 - Boards now supports [file attachments](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/work-with-cards.html#attach-files), including PDFs, images, videos, and any other file types.
 - Users can now [drag and drop boards and categories](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/navigate-boards.html#manage-boards-on-the-sidebar) on the sidebar and organize them in any order they prefer.
 - The [template picker](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/work-with-boards.html#choose-a-board-template) has been improved to make it easier for users to find the best template for their project.
 
#### Playbooks
 - Added an option to [run playbooks](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/work-with-playbooks.html#runs-and-channel-behavior) without creating a new channel every time in order to reduce the unnecessary overhead.
 - In addition to the daily digest, users can now also view [a task inbox](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/work-with-tasks.html#task-inbox) from the global header bar while in Playbooks.

#### Message Priority and Acknowledgments
 - Added [message priority labels](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/message-priority.html) to the Threads view.
 - Added support for users to request acknowledgements on posts and to acknowledge posts (Professional license).

#### Global Drafts
 - Added [a centralized Drafts view](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/send-messages.html#draft-messages) for draft messages.
 
#### ServiceNow Integration
 - ServiceNow customers can now access and share their ServiceNow data from within Mattermost.
 
#### ServiceNow Virtual Agent Integration
 - The [Mattermost ServiceNow Virtual Agent Integration](https://mattermost-2.wistia.com/medias/ixvgukv2qf) makes it easy for employees and customers to resolve issues fast.
 
#### GitLab Playbooks Integration
 - Through the updated [GitLab integration and playbook task actions](https://mattermost.com/marketplace/gitlab-plugin/), teams can automate release management processes to help increase efficiency and reduce errors.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Implemented progressive image loading in the webapp.
 - When the "Custom Brand Text" is left blank with custom branding enabled, the default text is now hidden.
 - The **Mark as Unread** option was added to the **More** (...) menu for channels in the left-hand side sidebar. Pressing Alt while selecting a channel on the left-hand side now also marks the last post in the channel as unread.
 - Channel members are now able to remove themselves from a channel via the right-hand side channel members list.
 - Removed video check to allow the browser to decide what video types it can play.
 - Added a tooltip to the right-hand side files filter icon.
 - The number of users that can be added to a user group at once was increased to 256.
 - Keyboard and focus handling was improved in profile popovers and @mentions.
 - Updated prepackaged version of plugins affected by React 17 upgrade.
 - Updated the **Remove license and download** text in-product to clarify that server will be downgraded to Mattermost Free as a result.
 - Updated prepackaged NPS version to 1.3.1.
 - Updated in-product confirmation modal for ``@here`` mentions to clarify that people & timezone counts don't include the current user.
 - Downgraded French language support to Beta.

#### Administration
 - If an Admin encounters an invitation error “SMTP is not configured in System Console", a link to the SMTP configuration within the **System Console** is now included in the error message.
 - Crashing jobs now sets the job status to "failed".
 - Optimized ``ThreadStore.MarkAllAsUnreadByTeam``.
 - SQL migrations for PostgreSQL will now filter by the current schema name when checking for information from the ``information_schema.columns`` view. This does not affect anything because usually there's only one installation in a given database, but this gives flexibility to users to store multiple Mattermost instances under a single database.
 - **My Insights** was added to the Free plan.
 - Team scheme APIs are now allowed to be administered with a Professional plan.
 - A global banner as well as a notice banner are displayed to admins on the **Invite** modal and on **System Console > Site Statistics > Total Activated Users** page when the workspace exceeds the maximum number of users allowed. If the number of actual users exceeds the number of paid users by less than 5%, the banner is dismissible. If the number of actual users exceeds the number of paid users by more than 10%, the banner is non-dismissible until the license seat count has been updated.
 - For admins to see if the amount of users exceeds the license seats, a warning is now shown in the **System Console > Team Statistics** page.
 - Added a new menu item on the **System Console > Users** page that re-adds users to all of their default teams and channels associated with the groups they're a member of.
 - Added ``acknowledgements`` field to the post's metadata.
 - Added support for product websocket messages on high availability instances.
 - The import job now logs the progress of the import.
 - Exports to S3 no longer time out.
 - Shared Channels (Experimental) was moved to Professional license.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in the ``config.json``:
    - ``PostPriority``, to add an option to select a message priority label for root posts.
    - ``AllowSyncedDrafts``, to add an option to display a centralized page for draft messages.
    - ``SelfHostedPurchase``, to add an option for self-hosted admins to purchase licenses in-app.
 - Under ``ExperimentalSettings`` in the ``config.json``:
    - ``PatchPluginsReactDOM``, to enable the patching of the React DOM library when loading web app plugins so that the plugin uses the version matching the web app.

### API Changes
 - The resumable uploads API was exposed to plugins.
 - Added a new API endpoint ``POST /api/v4/ldap/users/:user_id/group_sync_memberships`` to add (or re-add) users to all of their default teams and channels for all of the groups they're a member of.
 - Added two new URL parameters to the ``GET /api/v4/groups`` endpoint to get the ``ChannelMemberCount`` for a group.
 - Added new API endpoints ``POST /api/v4/users/:user_id/posts/:post_id/ack`` and ``DELETE /api/v4/users/:user_id/posts/:post_id/ack``.
 - Added a new API endpoint ``POST /api/v4/groups/:group_id:/restore``.
 - Added an allowed value ``sort=display_name`` to ``GET /api/v4/users?in_group=<groupid>``.
 - Added a new endpoint ``api/v4/cloud/products/selfhosted``.
 - A new API method ``RegisterCollectionAndTopic(collectionType, topicType string) (error)`` was added to the Plugin API and the following hooks. This API method is in beta, subject to change, and not covered by our backwards compatibility guarantee.
    - ``UserHasPermissionToCollection(c *Context, userID, collectionType, collectionId string, permission *model.Permission) (bool, error)``
    - ``GetAllCollectionIDsForUser(c *Context, userID, collectionType string) ([]string, error)``
    - ``GetAllUserIdsForCollection(c *Context, collectionType, collectionID string) ([]string, error)``
    - ``GetTopicRedirect(c *Context, topicType, topicID string) (string, error)``
    - ``GetCollectionMetadataByIds(c *Context, collectionType string, collectionIds []string) (map[string]model.CollectionMetadata, error)``
    - ``GetTopicMetadataByIds(c *Context, topicType string, topicIds []string) (map[string]*model.TopicMetadata, error)``

### Database Changes
 - Added a new Database table ``PostAcknowledgements``.
 
### Websocket Event Changes
 - Added new websocket events ``post_acknowledgement_added`` and ``post_acknowledgement_removed``.

### Go Version
 - v7.7 is built with Go ``v1.18.1``.

### Known Issues
 - Your profile image moves up when changing your status manually [MM-49159](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-49159).
 - The new Insights feature has some performance costs that we are working to optimize. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``.
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in high availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in high availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport results in duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.
 - Boards linked to a channel you're a member of do not automatically appear on your sidebar unless you're an explicit member of the board. As a workaround, you can access the board from the channel RHS or by searching for the board via the board switcher (Ctrl/Cmd+K). Alternatively, you can ask the board admin to add you to the board as an explicit member. See the [issue-focalboard-4179](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/4179) for more details.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.
 - If a user is not a member of a configured broadcast channel, posting a status update might fail without any error feedback. As a temporary workaround, join the configured broadcast channels or remove those channels from the run configuration.

## Release v7.6 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

  - The Mattermost v7.6 release has been cancelled as we are working on investigating performance issues. The next scheduled release is v7.7 in January 16th, 2023.

## Release v7.5 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v7.5.2, released 2022-12-21**
  - Mattermost v7.5.2 contains low to medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - Fixed an issue where email notifications looked broken when email batching was enabled [MM-48521](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-48521).
  - Updated prepackaged Boards version to 7.5.4.
  - Updated prepackaged NPS version to 1.3.1.
- **v7.5.1, released 2022-11-16**
  - Fixed an upgrade issue affecting servers on Ubuntu v18.04.
- **v7.5.0, released 2022-11-16**
  - Original 7.5.0 release

Mattermost v7.5.0 contains a medium severity level security fix. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - Adds a new schema migration to ensure ``ParentId`` column is dropped from the ``Posts`` table. Depending on the table size, if the column is not dropped before, a significant spike in database CPU usage is expected on MySQL databases. Writes to the table will be limited during the migration.
 - For ``PluginRegistry.registerCustomRoute``, when you register a custom route component, you must specify a CSS ``grid-area`` in order for it to be placed properly into the root layout (recommended: ``grid-area: center``).

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.4, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Compatibility
 - Updated the minimum version of Chrome and Edge to v106+.

### Highlights

#### Calls
 - Added new message threads with emoji reactions and @mentions to calls. After joining a call, expand the widget to the window mode, and then select the comment button to access the real-time message thread in the right-hand sidebar.

#### Boards
 - Added additional standard [board templates](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/work-with-boards.html#choose-a-board-template) to help users kick-off their next projects.
 - Filters now support all [text properties](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/work-with-cards.html#work-with-property-types).
 - Added two new tiles for System Console [Boards metrics](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/reporting-configuration-settings.html#site-statistics) under **System Console > Site Statistics**.
 
#### Last active status
 - Added a [“Last active” status](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/channels-settings.html#share-last-active-time) to the profile popover and to the **Direct Message** channel header that indicates when a user was last online. This status only displays for users who are Away, Offline, or in do-not-disturb (DND). This can be disabled via **Settings > Display > Share last active time**.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Renamed "Starter" plan to "Free" plan in product.
 - Added a new grid-based layout to the right-hand side and globalized the right-hand side and the Apps Bar.
 - A confirmation modal is now displayed before a user marks all threads as read.
 - Added the ability to hide the “required” asterisk in the App Field.

### Go Version
 - v7.5 is built with Go ``v1.18.1``.

### Known Issues
 - Guest users are unable to return to the login screen after being removed from all channels [MM-48438](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-48438).
 - Users are unable to open threads from recent mentions when switching to another team [MM-48399](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-48399).
 - When the right-hand side is expanded, an overlay is displayed with the Threads help text popup [MM-48412](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-48412).
 - The new Insights feature has some performance costs that we are working to optimize. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``.
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in high availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in high availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport results in duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.
 - Boards linked to a channel you're a member of do not automatically appear on your sidebar unless you're an explicit member of the board. As a workaround, you can access the board from the channel RHS or by searching for the board via the board switcher (Ctrl/Cmd+K). Alternatively, you can ask the board admin to add you to the board as an explicit member. See the [issue-focalboard-4179](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/4179) for more details.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

## Release v7.4 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v7.4.1, released 2022-12-21**
  - Mattermost v7.4.1 contains low to medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

- **v7.4.0, released 2022-10-16**
  - Original 7.4.0 release

Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

- **v7.3.0, released 2022-09-16**
  - Original 7.3.0 release

Mattermost v7.3.0 contains a medium severity level security fix. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Boards is moving from a channel-based to a role-based permissions system. The migration will happen automatically, but your administrator should perform a backup prior to the upgrade. We removed workspaces, so if you were a member of many boards prior to migration, they will now all appear under the same sidebar. Please see [this document](https://docs.mattermost.com/welcome/whats-new-in-v72.html) for more details.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.2, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Playbooks
 - Navigate between teams in Playbooks with the new team switcher.
 - Manage playbooks and runs in the new left-hand sidebar.
 - View the runs you're participating in or following in the **Runs** sidebar category, and view the playbooks you're a member of in the **Playbooks** sidebar category.
 - Favorite runs or playbooks to prioritize them in the **Favorites** category.
 - Participants now have access to every run feature on the new run details page.
 - Users can now request status updates (Professional).

#### Boards
 - All the boards you’re currently a member of from your current team will appear on the sidebar without needing to switch workspaces.
 - Organize boards on the sidebar with custom categories.
 - Press CTRL+K/CMD+K to find additional boards.
 - Navigate between teams in Boards with the new team switcher.
 - Set board and template permissions in the new **Share** setting.
 - Link boards to channels to automatically grant board permissions to channel members.
 - See [the documentation](/welcome/whats-new-in-v72.html) for more details.

#### Calls
 - Added support for standalone Calls server and Kubernetes (Enterprise).
 
#### New Insights Widgets
 - Added four new [Insights widgets](/welcome/insights.html): Most Active Direct Messages, Least Active Channels, Top Playbooks, and New Team Members.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added Calls keyboard shortcuts to the **Keyboard shortcuts** help modal.
 - Updated the "Contact Sales" link to ``mattermost.com/pl/contact-sales`` and update the pricing modal user interface.
 - Introduced a new ``/marketplace`` slash command that brings up the marketplace modal for the Admin, and changed the ``/help`` command so that it now keeps the user internal to Mattermost.
 - Team unreads are now calculated based on the channel membership and threads only. Team membership is no longer taken into account.
 - For introducing Boards and Playbooks to new users, an “explore other tools in platform” item was added to the end user onboarding checklist.
 - Added the **Save** option to the post menu.
 - Only the most recent message is now marked as unread when marking a thread as unread from the Threads list.
 - Insights filters now persist instead of being reset to default when switching to channels and returning back to the Insights view.
 - Code blocks now have better support for language filetype extensions and are a smaller bundle size.
 - A Desktop App prompt is now always shown on first visit to a Mattermost server from an email notification.
 - Search dropdown options now allow focusing by pressing the tab key.
 - Downgraded Bulgarian language support to Beta.

#### Administration
 - Added a **View Plan** button within the plan card via **System Console > License**.
 - Started tracking the join time of team members and added a new API endpoint to retrieve information about team members who have joined during a given time.
 - Introduced an optional ``shouldRender`` function parameter to ``registerchannelHeaderMenuAction`` plugin function. This allows menu items to conditionally render depending on the current state prior to rendering.
 - Plugins can now hide plugin settings based on the server's hosting environment.
 - Customers who are on a 30-day free trial are now notified three days before the trial ends.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where muted channels with an at-mention were displayed under the **Unreads** section of the channel switcher.
 - Fixed an issue where starting a trial failed if ``SiteURL`` was not set.
 - Fixed an issue where reading a thread on the mobile app caused a negative mention count to display on the web app.
 - Fixed an issue where the user's profile image persisted after user account deletion.
 - Fixed an issue where exports generated via mmctl without attachments still included the file properties in the post, so they couldn't be imported.
 - Fixed an issue that caused a crash when unread posts were fetched.
 - Fixed an issue where updating a profile image and creating new emojis used multipart uploads when using S3 storage.
 - Fixed an issue where the input legend on the custom group modal was cut off in Chrome.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Disable post formatting** setting was hidden when the advanced text editor was enabled.
 - Fixed an issue where we didn’t fall back to the user's default picture if a profile picture failed to load.
 - Fixed an issue where disabling a WebApp plugin from its configuration page resulted in the radio button reverting to ``true``.
 - Fixed an issue where the cursor sometimes jumped to the center channel textbox when the right-hand side was open.
 - Fixed an issue where closing the right-hand side also closed the edited post in the center channel.
 - Fixed an issue where selecting "Try free now" opened the top three enterprise features instead of the "Your trial has started" modal.
 - Fixed an issue where the Threads view displayed as unread even if there were no unread threads.
 - Fixed an issue where configuration changes could not be saved in the **System Console** in some cases.
 - Fixed typos in some translations that caused some in-product links to be broken.

### API Changes
 - Added new API endpoints:
 
	  - ``GET /api/v4/users/me/top/dms``
	  - ``GET /api/v4/users/me/top/threads``
	  - ``GET /api/v4/teams/:team_id/top/team_members``
	  - ``GET /api/v4/teams/:team_id:/top/threads``
 - Added ``first_inaccessible_post_time`` to post API responses.
 - Adds query parameter ``include_deleted`` to endpoint: ``{{[http://your-mattermost-url.com/api/v4/posts/{post_id}/files/info}}](http://your-mattermost-url.com/api/v4/posts/%7Bpost_id%7D/files/info%7D%7D)``.

### Go Version
 - v7.3 is built with Go ``v1.18.1``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``@floating-ui/react-dom-interactions`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.

### Known Issues
 - The new Insights feature has some performance costs that we are working to optimize. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``.
 - On larger screens, the Insights widgets are pushed to the side when the right-hand side is open [MM-46886](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-MM-46886).
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport results in duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

- **v7.2.0, released 2022-08-16**
  - Original 7.2.0 release

Mattermost v7.2.0 contains low to medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
Several schema changes impose additional database constraints to make the data more strict. All the commands listed below were tested on a 8 core, 16GB RAM machine. Here are the times recorded:

**PostgreSQL (131869 channels, 2 teams)**:

- ``CREATE TYPE channel_type AS ENUM ('P', 'G', 'O', 'D');`` took 14.114 milliseconds
- ``ALTER TABLE channels alter column type type channel_type using type::channel_type;`` took 3856.790 milliseconds (3.857 seconds)
- ``CREATE TYPE team_type AS ENUM ('I', 'O');`` took 4.191 milliseconds
- ``ALTER TABLE teams alter column type type team_type using type::team_type;`` took 116.205 milliseconds
- ``CREATE TYPE upload_session_type AS ENUM ('attachment', 'import');`` took 4.266 milliseconds
- ``ALTER TABLE uploadsessions alter column type type upload_session_type using type::upload_session_type;`` took 37.099 milliseconds

**MySQL (270959 channels, 2 teams)**:

- ``ALTER TABLE Channels MODIFY COLUMN Type ENUM("D", "O", "G", "P");`` took 13.24 seconds
- ``ALTER TABLE Teams MODIFY COLUMN Type ENUM("I", "O");`` took 0.04 seconds
- ``ALTER TABLE UploadSessions MODIFY COLUMN Type ENUM("attachment", "import");`` took 0.03 seconds

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.1, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Message Forwarding
 - You can now easily share messages as permalinks and respective permalink previews via the new [Post Forwarding feature](/channels/forward-messages.html). Simply select the new **Forward** option from the **More** section of the message hover actions menu on a given message, choose a desired destination, and optionally add a comment for context.
 
#### Audit Log v2 (Beta)
 - Added support for new [schema and output log types](/comply/audit-log.html). Contrary to the previous audit log implementation, all audit log records now have the same schema.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls v0.7.1.
 - Added the option to colorize usernames in compact display mode when **Account Settings > Display > Message Display > Compact** is selected.
 - Added a setting to always land users at the newest messages in a channel via **Account settings > Advanced > Scroll position when viewing an unread channel**.
 - Added email headers to notification emails so they can be threaded by email clients.
 - Added **Save** and **Cancel** buttons for post inline editing.
 - Enterprise trial details are now displayed for end users in the product switcher menu.
 - Updated the **Edit Header** modal text description to be applicable to channels, direct messages, and group messages.
 - Added a red destructive action color to ``Archive Channel`` and ``Leave Channel`` menu actions.
 - Plugin activation errors now show in the plugin management page and marketplace.
 - Added accessibility to the emoji picker skin tone selector and reversed the order of the skin tone selections in the emoji selector.

#### Administration
 - Added an **Upgrade** button for Admins on the navigation bar.
 - Added the ability for Admins to quickly view different paid license options inside the product.
 - Added the ability to start a trial from the **Invite People** modal.
 - Admins are now able to search for channel IDs via **System Console > User Management > Channels** page.
 - In the **System Console** left-hand side, paid features icons are now displayed on the menu entries to indicate enterprise features.
 - Added ``webSocketClient`` to ``Pluggable`` and ``PostWillRenderEmbed`` plugin registered components.
 - Added a new static system-level role called [Custom Group Manager](/onboard/system-admin-roles.html). This role has permissions to create, edit, and delete custom user groups via User Groups in the Products menu. It can be used to assign individual users this ability when Custom Groups permissions are removed for All Members via the **System Console** (**System Console > Permissions > Edit Scheme > Custom Groups**).
 - Export file names now contain the ID of the job they were generated by.

### Performance
 - Removed ``getLastPostPerChannel`` selector for improved performance in channel sorting.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with pasting a GitHub code snippet in the message box when text is selected.
 - Fixed an issue where fully typed emojis that contained a capital letter were not correctly displayed.
 - Fixed an issue where the archive icon for channels did not display correctly in dark themes.
 - Fixed an issue where password requirements were not enforced when Development Mode was enabled.
 - Fixed an issue where users were able to attempt to edit the channel header of an archived channel on the right-hand side.
 - Fixed an issue where the “Your Trial Ended” banner hid the product switcher menu.
 - Fixed an issue where the custom status date format was not set to ``YYYY-MM-DD``.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``FileSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - A new config setting ``AmazonS3RequestTimeoutMilliseconds`` was added which sets a timeout for requests to AWS S3. By default, the timeout is at 30 seconds.

#### API Changes
 - Added a new response-header ``Has-Inaccessible-Posts`` for ``getPost`` and ``getPostByIDs`` APIs.

### Go Version
 - v7.2 is built with Go ``v1.18.1``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``@types/color-hash``, ``color-contrast-checker``, ``color-hash``, and ``webpack`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.

### Known Issues
 - The new Insights feature has some performance costs that we are working to optimize. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``.
 - Forwarding messages: pressing Enter key on an auto-complete item in the comment box sends the forward message [MM-46142](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-46142).
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport results in duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - A new configuration option ``MaxImageDecoderConcurrency`` indicates how many images can be decoded concurrently at once. The default is -1, and the value indicates the number of CPUs present. This affects the total memory consumption of the server. The maximum memory of a single image is dictated by ``MaxImageResolution * 24 bytes``. Therefore, we recommend that ``MaxImageResolution * MaxImageDecoderConcurrency * 24`` should be less than the allocated memory for image decoding.
 - Mattermost v7.1 introduces schema changes in the form of a new column and its index. The following notes our test results for the schema changes:
    - MySQL 12M Posts, 2.5M Reactions - ~1min 34s (instance: PC with 8 cores, 16GB RAM)
    - PostgreSQL 12M Posts, 2.5M Reactions - ~1min 18s (instance: db.r5.2xlarge)
 - You can run the following SQL queries before the upgrade to obtain a lock on ``Reactions`` table, so that users' reactions posted during this time won't be reflected in the database until the migrations are complete. This is fully backwards-compatible.
    - For MySQL:
      - ``ALTER TABLE Reactions ADD COLUMN ChannelId varchar(26) NOT NULL DEFAULT "";``
      - ``UPDATE Reactions SET ChannelId = COALESCE((select ChannelId from Posts where Posts.Id = Reactions.PostId), '') WHERE ChannelId="";`` 
      - ``CREATE INDEX idx_reactions_channel_id ON Reactions(ChannelId) LOCK=NONE;``
  
    - For PostgreSQL:
      - ``ALTER TABLE reactions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS channelid varchar(26) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';``
      - ``UPDATE reactions SET channelid = COALESCE((select channelid from posts where posts.id = reactions.postid), '') WHERE channelid='';`` 
      - ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_reactions_channel_id on reactions (channelid);`` 

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v7.0, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Insights (Beta) (Enterprise and Professional)
 - Added workplace insights consisting of usage and behavior data, which helps Enterprises further increase productivity of their employees through Mattermost functionality. This feature can be disabled by setting the ``MM_FEATUREFLAGS_INSIGHTSENABLED`` environment variable to ``false``.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Playbooks v1.29.1, Boards v7.1.0, and Calls v0.7.0.
 - Recent emojis are now sorted based on the number of times an emoji has been used.
 - Improved the link preview user interface.
 - Added new search shortcuts to the **Keyboard Shortcuts** modal. 
    - CMD+F (macOS) and CTRL+F (Windows) for Desktop App
    - CMD+SHIFT+F (macOS) and CTRL+SHIFT+F (Windows) for webapp
 - Changed some tooltips to appear when focused instead of just on hover.
- Added support for syntax highlighting for 1C:Enterprise (BSL) language.

#### Administration
 - Default password requirements have been loosened to eight characters and no numeric, casing, or special characters required. These requirements can be configured by the System Admin as needed via **System Console > Password**.
 - The System Console now also searches and returns channels based on the channel ID. A new parameter ``IncludeSearchById`` was added to the channel search endpoint, allowing requests to include searches that match IDs in response.
 - Search results in PostgreSQL will now respect the ``default_text_search_config`` value instead of being hardcoded to English. Mattermost System Admins should check this value in case of any discrepancies with what is expected.
 - Moved ``UserHasJoinedTeam`` callback to after a user is added to a team.

#### Performance
 - Reduced the number of calls made to ``viewChannel`` API during regular usage.
 - Added pagination to the ``getPostThread`` API calls.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where links to internal help pages did not always open in a new browser tab.
 - Fixed an issue that caused the Channel Members right-hand side search input to not search all the members of a channel.

 - Fixed an issue where the bulk import failed due to reply ``CreateAt`` being greater than that of the parent post.
 - Fixed an undefined error when leaving a channel with the Unreads filter enabled.
 - Fixed an issue where clicking on a quick emoji reaction opened the right-hand pane.
 - Fixed an issue where the keyboard focus did not go back to the post textbox after hitting CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P twice.
 - Fixed an issue where the upload files button was positioned incorrectly.

 - Fixed an issue where **Group Messages** with long display names didn't have a tooltip in the left-hand sidebar.
 - Fixed an issue where the file icon was sometimes unresponsive.
 - Fixed a race condition where switching teams to an unread channel did not appear to mark that channel as read.
 - Fixed an issue where the error message did not appear if a user drafted a too long post.
 - Fixed an issue where channels with more than 100 members only showed 100 channel members in the right-hand side.
 - Fixed an issue where the preview mode in the advanced text editor did not reset after posting a message.
   
### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - The setting ``EnableInsecureOutgoingConnections`` is now applicable to S3 clients as well. If that is set, s3 clients will skip TLS verification.

#### API Changes
 - To allow Admins to retrieve contents of posts whether they are deleted or not, ``include_deleted`` query parameter was introduced to ``GetPost`` endpoint.
