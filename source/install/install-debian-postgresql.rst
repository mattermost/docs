Install PostgreSQL database server
-----------------------------------

Install and set up the database for use by the Mattermost server. You can install either PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Assume that the IP address of this server is 10.10.10.1

Install PostgreSQL on Debian Buster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Log in to the server that will host the database and issue the following command:

  ``sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib``

  When the installation is complete, the PostgreSQL server is running, and a Linux user account called *postgres* has been created.

2. Log in to the *postgres* account.

  ``sudo --login --user postgres``

3. Start the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

  ``psql``

4.  Create the Mattermost database.

  ``postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mattermost;``

5.  Create the Mattermost user 'mmuser'.

  ``postgres=# CREATE USER mmuser WITH PASSWORD 'mmuser-password';``

  .. note::
    Use a password that is more secure than 'mmuser-password'.

6.  Grant the user access to the Mattermost database.

  ``postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mattermost to mmuser;``

7. Exit the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

  ``postgres=# \q``

8. Log out of the *postgres* account.

  ``exit``

9. (Optional) If you use a different server for your database and the Mattermost app server, you may allow PostgreSQL to listen on all assigned IP Addresses. To do so, open ``/etc/postgresql/9.4/main/postgresql.conf`` as root in a text editor. As a best practice, ensure that only the Mattermost server is able to connect to the PostgreSQL port using a firewall.

  a. Find the following line:

    ``#listen_addresses = 'localhost'``

  b. Uncomment the line and change ``localhost`` to ``*``:

    ``listen_addresses = '*'``

  d. Restart PostgreSQL for the change to take effect:

    ``sudo systemctl restart postgresql``

10. Modify the file ``pg_hba.conf`` to allow the Mattermost server to communicate with the database.

  **If the Mattermost server and the database are on the same machine**:

    a. Open ``/etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf`` as root in a text editor.

    b. Find the following lines:

      ``local   all             all                        peer``
      
      ``host    all             all         ::1/128        ident``

    c. Change ``peer`` and ``ident`` to ``trust``:

      ``local   all             all                        trust``
      
      ``host    all             all         ::1/128        trust``

  **If the Mattermost server and the database are on different machines**:

    a. Open ``/etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf`` as root in a text editor.

    b. Add the following line to the end of the file, where *{mattermost-server-IP}* is the IP address of the machine that contains the Mattermost server.

      ``host all all {mattermost-server-IP}/32 md5``

11. Reload PostgreSQL:

  ``sudo systemctl reload postgresql``

12. Verify that you can connect with the user *mmuser*.

  a. If the Mattermost server and the database are on the same machine, use the following command:

    ``psql --dbname=mattermost --username=mmuser --password``

  b. If the Mattermost server is on a different machine, log into that machine and use the following command:

    ``psql --host={postgres-server-IP} --dbname=mattermost --username=mmuser --password``

    .. note::
      You might have to install the PostgreSQL client software to use the command.

  The PostgreSQL interactive terminal starts. To exit the PostgreSQL interactive terminal, type ``\q`` and press **Enter**.

With the database installed and the initial setup complete, you can now install the Mattermost server.
