Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------

Possible solutions to issues encountered when using the Desktop App.

"Installation has failed" dialog
    The app data might be corrupted - remove all the files in `C:\Users...\AppData\Local\mattermost`, then try re-installing the app.

Desktop App window is black and doesn't load the page
    - First try to clear cache and reload the app from **View** > **Clear Cache and Reload** or by pressing CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+R.
    - Next, quit the app and restart it to see if the issue clears.
    - If neither of the above works and you are using a special video driver such as Optimus, try disabling it to see if the problem is resolved.
    - Finally, try disabling GPU hardware acceleration by using the `--disable-gpu <http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#disable-gpu>`_ Chromium command line switch.

    If none of the above steps resolve the issue, please open a new ticket in the `Mattermost Troubleshooting Forum <https://forum.mattermost.org/t/how-to-use-the-troubleshooting-forum/150>`_.

Desktop App is not visible, but you can see the Mattermost icon in the Task Bar
  This issue can occur on Windows in a multiple-monitor setup. When you disconnect the monitor that Mattermost is displayed on, Mattermost continues to display at screen coordinates that no longer exist.

  To resolve this issue, you can reset the Desktop App screen location by deleting the screen location file. When the file is not present, the Desktop App displays on the primary monitor by default.

  **To reset the Desktop App screen location**:
    1. If the Desktop App is running, right-click the Mattermost icon in the task bar and click **Close Window**.
    2. Open Windows File Explorer, and navigate to the ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mattermost`` folder.
    3. Delete the file ``bounds-info.json``

Desktop App constantly refreshes the page
  This issue can occur when localStorage has an unexpected state. To resolve the issue:

    - Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, and navigate to the ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
    - Mac: Open Finder, and navigate to the ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
    - Linux: Open the file manager, and navigate to the ``~/.config/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
