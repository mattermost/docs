Troubleshooting
-----------------

"Installation has failed" dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The app data might be corrupted. Remove all the files in ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\mattermost``, then try reinstalling the app.
    
"The application "Mattermost" can't be opened" dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On macOS Catalina, this dialog can be triggered if the Mac Archive Utility is the default method for decompressing files. In this case using a third-party tool such as `Keka <https://www.keka.io>`_ or `Unarchiver <https://macpaw.com/the-unarchiver>`_ may resolve the problem.

Desktop App window is black and doesn't load the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First, make sure you have installed the latest desktop app version `from our website <https://about.mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`__. Check your app version from **Help > Version**.
2. Try to clear cache and reload the app from **View > Clear Cache and Reload** or use CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+R.
3. Quit the app and restart it to see if the issue clears.
4. Disable GPU hardware acceleration from **File > Settings** on Windows and Linux or **Mattermost > Settings** on macOS, and unselect **Use GPU hardware acceleration**.
5. If you are using a special video driver, such as Optimus, try disabling it to see if the problem is resolved.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, please open a new ticket in the `Mattermost Troubleshooting Forum <https://forum.mattermost.org/t/how-to-use-the-troubleshooting-forum/150>`__.

Desktop App is not visible, but the Mattermost icon is in the Task Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur on Windows in a multiple-monitor setup. When you disconnect the monitor that Mattermost is displayed on, Mattermost continues to display at screen coordinates that no longer exist.

To resolve this issue, you can reset the desktop app screen location by deleting the screen location file. When the file is not present, the desktop app displays on the primary monitor by default.

**To reset the desktop app screen location**

1. If the desktop app is running, right-click the Mattermost icon in the task bar and click **Close Window**.
2. Open Windows File Explorer, and navigate to the **%APPDATA%\\Mattermost** folder.
3. Delete the file ``bounds-info.json``.

Desktop App constantly refreshes the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This issue can occur when ``localStorage`` has an unexpected state. To resolve the issue:

- Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, navigate to the ``%APPDATA%\Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
- Mac: Open Finder, navigate to the ``~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
- Linux: Open the File Manager, navigate to the ``~/.config/Mattermost`` folder, then delete the ``Local Storage`` folder.
      
Desktop App constantly asks to log in to Mattermost server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue can occur after a crash or unexpected shutdown of the desktop app that causes the app data to be corrupted. To resolve the issue:

- Windows: Open Windows File Explorer, navigate to the **%APPDATA%\\Mattermost** folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.
- Mac: Open Finder, navigate to the **~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost** folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.
- Linux: Open the file manager, navigate to the **~/.config/Mattermost** folder, then delete the ``IndexedDB`` folder and the ``Cookies`` and ``Cookies-journal`` files.

"Internal error: BrowserWindow 'unresponsive' event has been emitted"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking **Show Details** on the dialog provides logs. Ways to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the cache via **View > Clear Cache and Reload** or CTRL+SHIFT+R .
2. Go to App Settings via **File > Settings** or CTRL+COMMA or and unselect hardware acceleration.
  
Desktop app not responsive within Citrix Virtual Apps or Desktop Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reporting Issues
--------------------------------------------------

When reporting bugs found in the Mattermost desktop app, it is helpful to include the contents of the Developer Tools Console along with `the information on this page <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/support.html#general-questions-for-any-issues>`__. To access the Developer Tools Console, follow these instructions:

1. In the menu bar, go to **View > Toggle Developer Tools**.
2. Select the **Console** tab.
3. Right-click the log window and select **Save As**.
4. Save the file and then send it along with a description of your issue.
5. Go to **View > Toggle Developer Tools** to disable the Developer Tools.

You can open an additional set of developer tools for each server you have added to the desktop app. The tools can be opened by pasting this command in the Developer Tools Console you opened with the steps described above: 

``document.getElementsByTagName("webview")[0].openDevTools();`` 

Note that if you have more than one server added to the desktop client, you need to change the 0 to the number corresponding to the server you want to open in the Developer Tools Console, starting with 0 from the left.
