Production Docker Setup on Ubuntu
----------------------------------------------------

1. **Install Docker** using `the Ubuntu online guide <https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/>`__ or these instructions:

   .. code:: bash

       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install wget
       wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
       sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
       sudo service docker start
       newgrp docker

2. **Install Docker Compose** using `the online guide <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__. You have to download the latest release from the `Docker Compose Github page <https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/>`__ and put the binary on your :code:`/usr/local/bin` folder. Usually, you can use the following command, replacing :code:`$dockerComposeVersion` with the Docker Compose version to install:

   .. code:: bash
   
      sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$dockerComposeVersion/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

3. **Deploy the Mattermost Production Docker** setup by running:

   .. code:: bash
   
       sudo apt-get install git
       git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker.git
       cd mattermost-docker
       docker-compose build
       mkdir -pv ./volumes/app/mattermost/{data,logs,config,plugins,client-plugins}
       sudo chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost/
       docker-compose up -d

4. **Configure TLS** by following `the instructions <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker#install-with-ssl-certificate>`__.

5. **Configure Email** by following the `SMTP email setup guide <http://docs.mattermost.com/install/smtp-email-setup.html>`__.

6. (Optional) To enable enterprise features under **System Console** > **Edition and License** upload your `trial license <https://about.mattermost.com/trial/>`__ or `subscription license file <https://about.mattermost.com/pricing/>`__ received via email.

7. **Configure your Server** based on the `configuration settings documentation <http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html>`__.
