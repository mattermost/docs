Installing Debian Buster
========================

Install the 64-bit version of Debian on each machine that hosts one or more of the components.

**To install Debian Buster:**

1. To install Debian Buster, see the `Debian Installation Guide (PDF). <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/install.pdf>`__

2. After the system is installed, make sure that it's up to date with the most recent security patches. Open a terminal window and issue the following commands as root:

  ``apt-get update``

  ``apt-get upgrade``

3. Install *sudo* and *curl* for use later in the installation:

  ``apt-get install sudo curl gnupg``

4. Add your username to the sudo group. In the following command, replace {username} with your own username.

  ``usermod -a -G sudo {username}``

Now that the system is up to date and our user is in the sudo group, you can start installing the components that make up a Mattermost system.
