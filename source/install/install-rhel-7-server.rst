Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
-----------------------------------

Install the 64-bit version of RHEL 7 on each machine that hosts one or more of the components.

Install RHEL 7 Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. To install RHEL 7, see the `RedHat Installation Instructions <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/>`__.

2. After the system is installed, make sure that it's up to date with the most recent security patches. Open a terminal window and issue the following commands:

  ``sudo yum update``
  
  ``sudo yum upgrade``

Now that the system is up to date, you can start installing the components that make up a Mattermost system.

.. note:: 

  Ensure that the ``mailcap`` package is installed as it includes the ``mime.types`` file which is needed for the Mobile App to work correctly.
