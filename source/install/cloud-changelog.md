## Release 2023-06-26

### Highlights
 - Insights has been disabled for all new instances and for existing servers that upgrade to v8.0. See more details in [this forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/proposal-to-revise-our-insights-feature-due-to-known-performance-issues/16212) on why Insights has been disabled.
 - Boards is now operating as a plugin and can be enabled or disabled in the **System Console > Plugin settings**. The Boards configuration, ``EnablePublicSharedBoards``, was also removed from the config and the **System Console**.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)

 - Calls: Ringing sounds can be enabled/disabled and selected in the Desktop Notifications preferences panel.
 - Bumped the pre-packaged version of NPS to 1.3.2.

#### Administration
 - Playbooks is again shipped as a prepackaged plugin, with version 1.36.1.
 - Added a new ``ConfigurationWillBeSaved`` plugin hook which is invoked before the configuration object is committed to the backing store.
 - Admins can now specify index names to ignore while purging indexes from Elasticsearch with the ``ElasticsearchSettings.IgnoredPurgeIndexes`` setting.
 - Added an option to use the German HPNS notification proxy.
 - New flags were added to the database migrate command as following:

    - ``auto-recover``: If the migration plan receives an error during migrations, this command will try to rollback migrations already applied within the plan. This option is not recommended to be added without reviewing migration plan. You can review the plan by combining ``--save-plan`` and ``--dry-run`` flags.
    - ``save-plan``: The plan for the migration will be saved into the file store so that it can be used for reviewing the plan or to be used for downgrading.
    - ``dry-run``: Does not apply the migrations, but it validates how the migration would run with the given conditions.

 - A new database subcommand "downgrade" was added to be able to rollback database migrations. The command either requires an update plan to rollback, or comma separated version numbers.
 - Removed ``/api/v4/users/stats`` network request from ``InviteMembersButton``.

### API Changes
 - Introduce the [public](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/public) submodule, housing the familiar `model` and `plugin` packages, but now discretely versioned from the server. It is no longer necessary to `go get` a particular commit hash, as Go programs and plugins can now opt-in to importing `github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/public` and managing versions idiomatically. While this submodule has not yet shipped a v1 and will introduce breaking changes before stabilizing the API, it remains both forwards and backwards compatible with the Mattermost server itself.
  - In the main `server package`, the Go module path has changed from ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/v8`` to ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8``. But with the introduction of the `public` submodule, it should no longer be necessary for third-party code to import this `server` package.
 - As part of the `public` submodule above, a ``context.Context`` is now passed to ``model.Client4`` methods.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed the **New Messages** line overlapping date lines in the post list.
 - Fixed an issue where post reactions disappeared when the search sidebar was open.
 - Fixed an issue with broken "medical_symbol", "male_sign", and "female_sign" emojis.
 - Fixed a panic where a JSON null value was passed as a channel update.
 - Fixed an issue where the draft counter badge remained in cases where a deleted parent post was removed.
 - Fixed an issue where posts were not fully sanitized for audit output when a link preview was included.
 - Fixed an issue where the footer with **Save/Cancel** buttons did not get anchored properly in the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue where the undo history was erased when links, tables, or code was pasted into the textbox.
 - Fixed an issue where Elasticsearch didn't properly start on startup when enabled. Also added a missing ``IsEnabled`` method to Elasticsearch.
 - Fixed an issue where text couldn't be copied from the post textbox.

### Known Issues
 - Boards public links that follow the URL schema `/boards/public/...` will not work after this update. They can either be regenerated through the application by going to the board and selecting the **Share** button at the top right, or they can be obtained by replacing the `/boards/public/` part of the URL with `/plugins/focalboard/`.
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

## Release 2023-06-13

### Compatibility
- Updated Chromium minimum supported version to 112+.

### Improvements

### Bug Fixes
 - Ensured users mentioned in message attachments are loaded by the web app.
 - Fixed an issue where the reply bar did not get highlighted when a user was mentioned by a reply because of their Reply Notifications setting.
 - Fixed an issue where the total user count was fetched for every client connection. It is only necessary to fetch this once.
 - Fixed an issue where the date separator displayed in the center channel for every post when the pinned posts right-hand side panel was open.

### Known Issues
 - Using the "link" button puts the URL after ``[url]`` instead of replacing ``[url]`` when pasting [MM-53006](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53006).
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

## Release 2023-05-31

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added a persistent notification option when sending urgent priority posts.
 - Added an experimental feature to disable re-fetching of channel and channel members on browser focus.
 - Bot users are now hidden in the user selector in apps forms.
 - Removed the fetching of archived channels on page load.
 - The **Channel Type** dropdown within the **Browse Channels** modal can now be focused.
 - Removed in-app help pages that were no longer accessible.
 - Removed system join/leave messages from thread replies and post them instead in the main channel.
 - Added an experimental setting to make the channel autocomplete only appear after typing two characters instead of immediately after the tilde (~).
 - Users with default profile pictures will now regenerate a new picture when their username is changed.
 - Implemented URL auto generation on channel creation for when there's no URL safe characters on its name.
 - Added a new option to auto-follow all threads in the channel **Notification Preference** settings.
 - ``CTRL/CMD + K`` shortcut can now be used to insert link formatting when text is selected.
 - ``pas`` and ``pascal`` code blocks are now higlighted.
 - Language setting in Boards was removed. The main language setting under **Settings -> Display Settings** now covers Boards. Boards previously supported Catalan, Greek, Indonesian, and Occitan, but since these 4 languages were only partially translated (<40%; Boards-only), they have been removed until more areas of Mattermost are translated into these languages.
 - Removed websocket state effects for the collapse/expand state of categories.
 - Pre-packaged Calls version 0.16.1.
 - Pre-packaged Jira plugin version 3.2.5.
 - Pre-packaged GitHub plugin version 2.1.6.
 - Pre-packaged Autolink plugin version 1.4.0.
 - Pre-packaged Welcomebot plugin version 1.3.0.

#### Administration
 - The Go module has been upgraded to v8.0. All packages are now under the new path ``github.com/mattermost-server/server/v8``.
 - Type-generated settings will now be generated (only for future generations) with a URL-safe version of base64 encoding.
 - Mattermost is now resilient against database replica outages and will dynamically choose a replica if it's alive. Also a config parameter ``ReplicaMonitorIntervalSeconds`` was added and the default value is 5. This controls how frequently unhealthy replicas will be monitored for liveness check.
 - Removed ``ExperimentalSettings.PatchPluginsReactDOM``.
 - Removed deprecated ``PermissionUseSlashCommands``.
 - Added support for attachments when importing/exporting Boards.
 - Updated Docker Base Image from Debian to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
 - Removed support for PostgreSQL v10. The new minimum PostgreSQL version is now v11.
 - The Mattermost public API for Go is now available as a distinctly versioned package. Instead of pinning a particular commit hash, use idiomatic Go to add this package as a dependency: go get github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/server/public. This relocated Go API maintains backwards compatibility with Mattermost v7. Furthermore, the existing Go API previously at github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/v6/model remains forward compatible with Mattermost v8, but may not contain newer features. Plugins do not need to be recompiled, but developers may opt in to using the new package to simplify their build process. The new public package is shipping alongside Mattermost v8 as version 0.5.0 to allow for some additional code refactoring before releasing as v1 later this year.
 - Three configuration fields have been added, ``LogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, ``ExperimentalAuditSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON``, and ``NotificationLogSettings.AdvancedLoggingJSON`` which support multi-line JSON, escaped JSON as a string, or a filename that points to a file containing JSON.  The ``AdvancedLoggingConfig`` fields have been deprecated.
 - The Go MySQL driver has changed the ``maxAllowedPacket`` size from 4MiB to 64MiB. This is to make it consistent with the change in the server side default value from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. If your ``max_allowed_packet`` setting is not 64MiB, then please update the MySQL config DSN with an additional param of ``maxAllowedPacket`` to match with the server side value. Alternatively, a value of 0 can be set to to automatically fetch the server side value, on every new connection, which has a performance overhead.
 - For servers wanting to allow websockets to connect from other origins, please set the ``ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom`` config setting.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed the sorting value of categories in ``CreateSidebarCategoryForTeamForUser``.
 - Fixed a potential crash when opening the user profile popover.
 - Fixed permalink and thread reply navigation between teams.
 - Fixed an issue with the installation of pre-packaged plugins that are not in the Marketplace.
 - Fixed an issue caused by a migration in a previous release. The query takes around 11ms on a PostgreSQL 14 DB t3.medium RDS instance. Locks on the preferences table will only be acquired if there are rows to delete, but the time taken is negligible.
 - Fixed an issue where modals did not close when clicking below them on certain screen sizes.
 - Fixed an issue with a few translation labels that couldn't be translated.
 - Fixed an issue where the server log UI for plain text formatting was unexpectedly removed in a previous release.
 - Fixed an issue where combined system messages did not display in chronological order.
 - Fixed an issue where the current user and status were not updated on WebSocket reconnect.
 - Fixed an issue where certain hashtags were not searchable when using database search.

### Known Issues
 - Selecting the **replies** option for a thread doesn't navigate to the thread when Collapsed Reply Threads is enabled. A workaround is to use the reply arrow in the post menu, or to navigate to the **Threads** view when replying to messages [MM-52995](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-52995).
 - Using the "link" button puts the URL after ``[url]`` instead of replacing ``[url]`` when pasting [MM-53006](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53006).
 - Saved posts in right-hand side show both the team and channel name in the post header [MM-53005](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-53005).
 - In a cluster config save scenario, it is difficult to disinguish between a timeout and a semantic error in the config if a config save in one node gets stuck [MM-52968](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-52968).
 - The URL of the post in a reminder post for direct and group messages have a double slash on mobile [MM-51026](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-51026).
 - The Playbooks left-hand sidebar does not update when a user is added to a run or playbook without a refresh.

 - Pre-packaged Calls v0.15.1.

#### Administration

### API Changes
 - An underscore is now used in the timeline API (``event-id`` -> ``event_id``) for consistency with other API arguments.

 - Fixed an issue where clicking on a channel link (for a channel the user was not a part of) caused the webapp to refresh, dropping the user from a call.
 - Fixed an issue with PDF preview rendering for certain Japanese characters.
 - Fixed an issue where the screen reader did not announce the action of copying the link in the invite modal.
 - Fixed an issue with post metadata not generating correctly for images due to missing content-type in response. This would result in certain embedded images not to display on mobile clients.
 - Fixed an issue where edits to messages persisted after canceling.
 - Added a condition for bot tags for webhook posts when a bot account is used for webhooks.

### Known Issues
 - Message Actions … ellipsis menu icon only displays rectangle when clicked on [MM-52444](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-52444).
 - The URL of the post in a reminder post for direct and group messages have a double slash on mobile [MM-51026](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-51026).

Developers should read the updated [Developer Guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/developer-setup/) for details. Playbooks and Boards are now core parts of the product that cannot be disabled.
 - The file info stats query is now optimized by denormalizing the ``channelID`` column into the table itself. This will speed up the query to get the file count for a channel when selecting the right-hand pane. Migration times:

   - On a MySQL 8.0.31 DB with 1405 rows in FileInfo and 11M posts, it took around 0.3s
   - On a PostgreSQL 12.14 DB with 1731 rows in FileInfo and 11M posts, it took around 0.27s

For more information, see the [W3C Reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions-policy/) or [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy).

## Release 2023-01-16

 - The [Mattermost ServiceNow Virtual Agent Integration](https://www.loom.com/share/36f60299c6c349729160d6d8bce75c3c) makes it easy for employees and customers to resolve issues fast.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Updated prepackaged version of plugins affected by React v17 upgrade.
 - Corrected in-product System Console legacy link to the Cloud Administrator's Guide.
 - Updated prepackaged NPS version to 1.3.1.
 - Updated prepackaged version of Apps plugin to 1.2.0.
 - Added group members count to the group autocomplete.
 - Clicking a group mention now displays group details and membership.
 - Improved the collapsed state of the post formatting toolbar.
 - App Framework channel and user fields now support multi-select properties to allow users to select multiple values in a form.
 - Increased the character count for desktop notifications on Windows to 120 from 50.
 - Prioritized members of recently viewed direct or group messages when adding users to a channel.
 - Updated in-product confirmation modal for ``@here`` mentions to clarify that people & timezone counts don't include the current user.
 - Added support for multiple users and channels to the ``/invite`` slash command.
 - Downgraded French language support to Beta.

#### Administration
 - The export file now contains the server version and a creation timestamp.
 - Plugins with a webapp component may need to be updated to work with Mattermost and the updated React v17 dependency. This is to avoid plugins crashing with an error about ``findDOMNode`` being called on an unmounted component. While our `starter template <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-starter-template>`_ depended on an external version of ``React``, it did not do the same for ``ReactDOM``. Plugins need to update their ``webpack.config.js`` directives to externalize ``ReactDOM``. For reference, see https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/pull/1489. Server-side only plugins are unaffected. This change can be done for existing plugins any time prior to upgrading Mattermost and is backwards compatible with older versions of Mattermost.
 - Added ``acknowledgements`` field to the post's metadata.

 - Improved bulk export logging.
 - Compliance export job can now cancel the SQL query execution during server shutdown which will allow the job to exit faster.
 - Shared Channels (Experimental) is now available with a Professional license.
 - Removed Cloud Professional file storage limits.
 - The message export compliance job can now survive server restarts. The job will pause and save state when the server is shutting down, and resume from the previously saved state when the server starts back up.
 - Only one instance of the job will be automatically scheduled to run as per the ``MessageExportSettings.DailyRunTime`` config value.
 - Mattermost will throw an error if it detects an Elasticsearch version greater than 7.

### API Changes

 - Fixed an issue where servers with an encrypted key did not throw an error during startup.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Test Connection** button in **System Console > Environment > Elasticsearch** did not correctly take the right config settings specified in the page. Earlier, it would always take the previously saved config.

## Release 2021-05-05

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - If message autoresponder is set, only one message is now sent to a given user irrespective of how many Direct Message messages the user receives.
 - Added status icons on **Add members** to channel and **Add members** to team lists.
 - Added a keyboard shortcut to focus on the Search bar and search in the current channel.

#### Administration
 - Gossip clustering mode is now in General Availability and is no longer available as an option. All cluster traffic will always use the gossip protocol. The config setting ``UseExperimentalGossip`` has no effect and has only been kept for compatibility purposes. The setting to use gossip has been removed from the System Console. **Note:** For High Availability upgrades, all nodes in the cluster must use a single protocol. If an existing system is not currently using gossip, one node in a cluster can't be upgraded while other nodes in the cluster use an older version. Customers must either use gossip for their High Availability upgrade, or customers must shut down all nodes, perform the upgrade, and then bring all nodes back up.
 - ``TCP_NO_DELAY`` is disabled for Websocket connections to allow for higher throughput.
 - Compliance Monitoring CSV files are no longer limited to 30,000 rows.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue with an incorrect error message when trying to change handle via API to another one that already existed.
 - Fixed an issue where LDAP Group Sync didn't work when using SAML (ADFS) for authentication and AD/LDAP Group Sync unless ``EnableSyncWithLdapIncludeAuth`` was set to ``true``, which caused the ``AuthData`` to be stored in AD/LDAP format.
 - Fixed an issue where a user with 'No Access' permission could still access **Groups**, **Channels** and **Teams** configuration pages through a URL.
 - Fixed an issue where **Remove from channel** and **Remove Team Member** menu items were visible in a group-synced channel or team.

 - Sometimes an "Unable to get role" error appears when changing a channel member role in **System Console > User Management > Channels**.
 - **Cloud > "Tips & Next Steps"** should not show an "Explore channels" section for guest users.
 - System Roles shows **License** and **Environment** as possible permissions, but they are always hidden in Cloud.

## Release 2021-04-22

### Highlights

#### Apps Framework (Developer Preview)
 - The Mattermost Apps Framework introduces a new way to integrate with external tools to allow developers to create interactive Apps in Mattermost using any development language they're comfortable with. These Apps work seamlessly across mobile and desktop clients. This is a developer preview that is not yet intended for production instances of Mattermost. The Apps Framework will be available for self-managed customers in Mattermost v5.35 once the Apps Framework Plugin is loaded on an instance. Until then, developers can use the `cloud` branch to get a local test environment running. The launch for the Developer Preview of the Apps Framework is scheduled for April 29th, 2021. Learn more: https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/.

#### Search Results Are Returned on File Search
 - Searching in Mattermost now finds both relevant messages and files in your team's conversation history. Search will return results for attachments that match the file name or contain matching text content within supported document types. Learn more. To be available for mobile apps in a later release.

#### Granular Access to System Console Pages
 - Migrated the following System Console sections to their respective sub-section permissions: Experimental, About, Reporting, Environment, Site Configuration, Authentication, Integrations, and Compliance.

#### Shared Channels (Experimental)
 - Experimental support was added for sharing channels between Mattermost clusters. This feature is disabled by default.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added support to collapse in-line images over 100px in height.
 - Implemented maximum length validation on the status modal for custom statuses.
 - Synchronized collapsed channel sidebar categories on the server.
 - Empty state is no longer off-centered in the **Channel Switcher**.
 - Ephemeral message created from call response ``markdown`` field is now posted by bot.

For example, fixed an issue where recently selected statuses were missing from the **Set a Status** confirmation screen, and updated the **Mobile Push Notifications** text in **Account Settings** to refer to user **availability** instead of **online status**.
 - Moved the user status in the channel switcher to overlap with user avatars, and added URL 'Slug' information to channel names in the channel switcher.

#### Administration
 - Paused admin advisor notifications from triggering.
 - Added a command line document extraction command that allows indexing documents by content.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed link previews on a number of websites, including Reddit.

 - System Roles shows **License** and **Environment** as possible permissions, but they are always hidden in Cloud.

## Release 2021-04-07

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added a string field to configuration for restricted domains with the key ``RestrictLinkPreviews`` and added a UI field for restricted domains under **System Console > Site Configuration > Posts**. Also expanded the logic that determines whether a post has a preview or not.
 - Added an unread badge to the **Main Menu** icon and the **Plugin Marketplace** menu that displays until a System Admin visits the **Plugin Marketplace** for the first time.
 - Removed Beta tags from Swedish and Bulgarian languages.
 - Added profile pictures to the **Direct Messages** channel list.
 - Added channel icons for email notifications as part of email notification redesigns.
 - Direct Messages **More...** modal is now sorted by recent conversations when the modal is opened.
 - Removed legacy Open-Sans fonts and upgraded Open-Sans to v18.

#### Administration
 - Removed the utility function ``model.GeneratePassword()`` for security reasons. An improved version is now being used internally to generate passwords for bulk-imported users.
 - Only the System Admin is allowed to have the ability to assign system roles.
 - Two new gauge metrics were added: ``mattermost_db_replica_lag_abs`` and ``mattermost_db_replica_lag_time``, both containing a label of "node", signifying which database host is the metric from. 
     - These metrics signify the replica lag in absolute terms and in the time dimension capturing the whole picture of replica lag. To use these metrics, a separate config section ``ReplicaLagSettings`` was added under ``SqlSettings``. This is an array of maps which contain three keys: ``DataSource``, ``QueryAbsoluteLag``, and ``QueryTimeLag``. Each map entry is for a single replica instance. ``DataSource`` contains the database credentials to connect to the replica instance. ``QueryAbsoluteLag`` is a plain SQL query that must return a single row of which the first column must be the node value of the Prometheus metric, and the second column must be the value of the lag. ``QueryTimeLag`` is the same as above, but used to measure the time lag. 
     - As an example, for AWS Aurora instances, the ``QueryAbsoluteLag`` can be: ``select server_id highest_lsn_rcvd-durable_lsn as bindiff from aurora_global_db_instance_status()`` where ``server_id=<>`` and ``QueryTimeLag`` can be: ``select server_id, visibility_lag_in_msec aurora_global_db_instance_status()`` where ``server_id=<>``. For MySQL Group Replication, the absolute lag can be measured from the number of pending transactions in the applier queue: ``select member_id, count_transactions_remote_in_applier_queue FROM performance_schema.replication_group_member_stats`` where ``member_id=<>``. Overall, what query to choose is left to the administrator, and depending on the database and need, an appropriate query can be chosen.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to deactivate MFA for their accounts even if MFA was disabled on the server.
 - Fixed an issue where user settings on API could be set if LDAP Sync was on. For LDAP and SAML users, the following fields cannot be changed via the API if the corresponding LDAP/SAML attributes have been set: first name, last name, position, nickname, email, profile picture. For OAUTH users (i.e., Gitlab, Google, Office365 and OpenID), the following fields cannot be changed via the API: first name, last name. All users who authenticate via a method other than email cannot change their username via the API.
 - Fixed a possible panic on post creation when the collapsed threads feature was enabled.
 - Fixed a database deadlock that could happen if a sidebar category was updated and deleted at the same time.
 - Fixed an issue where the sidebar **Text Hover BG Theme** color didn’t work on the left-hand side.
 - Fixed an issue where the Team Admin’s current role was presented inconsistently in the different areas of the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Show more** background color on long posts was broken for permalinks.
