Changing a License Key
----------------------

To change an existing license key on an Enterprise Edition server to a new license key:

1. In the **System Console**, go to **OTHER** > **Edition and License** > **License Key** and click "Remove Enterprise License and Downgrade Server". This clears the license from the server and refreshes the System Console. 
2. In the **System Console**, go to **OTHER** > **Edition and License** > **License Key** and upload the new license key file.
   
The **Edition** and **License** sections on the page should update to show the capabilities of your new license key.
