1. To install Ubuntu Server 20.04, see the `Ubuntu Installation Guide. <https://help.ubuntu.com/20.04/installation-guide/amd64/index.html>`__

2. After the system is installed, make sure that it's up to date with the most recent security patches. Open a terminal window and issue the following commands:
