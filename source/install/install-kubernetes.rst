You can install and deploy a production-ready Mattermost system on a Kubernetes cluster using the Mattermost Kubernetes Operator in practically any environment with less IT overhead and more automation.

Mattermost supports Kubernetes clusters running either self-hosted in data centers, or in managed services such as Amazon EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Kubernetes Engine, DigitalOcean Kubernetes, and others.

You'll need a `Kubernetes cluster <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/>`__ running `a version that is currently supported with patch releases <https://kubernetes.io/releases/>`__,  Kubernetes CLI `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/>`__ installed on local machine, and a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (such as deployments, pods) and actions (such as applying manifests, viewing pod logs). Running Mattermost in Kubernetes requires resources based on your total number of users. See the :ref:`Mattermost Kubernetes Operator <install/install-kubernetes:mattermost operator>` documentation to learn more about the minimum Kubernetes cluster resources Mattermost requires at different scales.

.. tip::
    
    - If youâ€™re unsure about which environment you want to use for your Kubernetes cluster, we suggest using a managed service such as as `Amazon EKS <https://aws.amazon.com/eks/>`__, `Azure Kubernetes Service <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/kubernetes-service/>`__, `Google Kubernetes Engine <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/>`__, or `DigitalOcean Kubernetes <https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/>`__.

Install the operators
---------------------

Nginx Ingress Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the `Kubernetes deployment documentation <https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/>`__ for details on installing the NGINX ingress controller in your Kubernetes cluster.

Mattermost Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple ways to install the Mattermost Kubernetes Operator. We recommend deploying with Helm, but installation instructions via the Kubernetes CLI can also be found below.

With Helm
^^^^^^^^^

1. Install Helm. We recommend Helm v3.13.0 or later. For installation instructions, see the `Helm quickstart documentation <https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart>`__.
2. Once Helm is installed and initialized, run the following:

  .. code-block:: sh

    helm repo add mattermost https://helm.mattermost.com

3. Create a file named ``config.yaml``, then copy and paste the content of `the Mattermost operator file <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-helm/blob/master/charts/mattermost-operator/values.yaml>`__ into it.


4. Create a namespace for the Mattermost Operator:

  .. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create ns mattermost-operator

5. Install your preferred version of the Mattermost Operator using the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

    helm install <your-release-name> mattermost/mattermost-operator -n <namespace_name>

  For example:

  .. code-block:: sh

    helm install mattermost-operator mattermost/mattermost-operator -n mattermost-operator

  To install with any customized configuration you've made in your ``config.yaml`` file, use the ``-f`` flag:

  .. code-block:: sh

    helm install mattermost-operator mattermost/mattermost-operator -n mattermost-operator -f config.yaml

  .. tip::
      If no version is specified, the latest version of the Mattermost Operator will be installed.

With Kubernetes CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``kubectl`` can be used to install the Mattermost Operator if using ``helm`` is not an option. 

1. Create a namespace for the Mattermost Operator:

  .. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create ns mattermost-operator

2. Install the Mattermost Operator:

  .. code-block:: sh

    kubectl apply -n mattermost-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattermost/mattermost-operator/master/docs/mattermost-operator/mattermost-operator.yaml

Deploy Mattermost
-----------------
  
1. (Mattermost Enterprise only) Create a Mattermost license secret by opening a text editor and creating a secret manifest containing the Mattermost license. Replace ``[LICENSE_FILE_CONTENTS]`` below with the contents of your Mattermost license file. Save the file as ``mattermost-license-secret.yaml``.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-mattermost-license
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      license: <LICENSE_FILE_CONTENTS>

  .. note::
    A Mattermost Enterprise license is required for a seamless experience deploying Mattermost with multiple server instances. If you plan to deploy Mattermost without an Enterprise license, we recommend a single server deployment by adding ``Replicas:  1`` to the ``spec`` section in step 2.
    See the :doc:`high availability </scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>` documentation for details on running a highly-available Mattermost deployment.

2. Create an installation manifest file ``mattermost-installation.yaml`` locally, and open it with a text editor. Copy and paste the YAML structure below, and make any necessary adjustments for your configuration and environment. 

  .. code-block:: yaml

      apiVersion: installation.mattermost.com/v1beta1
      kind: Mattermost
      metadata:
        name: <INSTALLATION_NAME_HERE>                # Chose the desired installation name. Example = mm-example-full
      spec:
        size: <SIZE_VALUE_HERE>                       # Adjust to your requirements. Example = 5000users
        ingress:
          enabled: true
          host: <FULL_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE>               # Adjust to your domain. Example = example.mattermost-example.com
          annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        version: <VERSION_HERE>                       # Select a recent supported version of Mattermost. Example = 9.3.0
        licenseSecret: ""                             # If you created a license secret in step 1, put the secret name here
    
  .. note::
    While file names are provided, your file names can be different. The file names in this tutorial are used for clarity and organization.

  Some of the most commonly-used fields include:

  .. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description"

    "metadata.name", "The name of your Mattermost as it will be shown in Kubernetes. The shorter the better."
    "spec.size", "The size of your installation. This can be '100users', '1000users, '5000users', '10000users', or '25000users'."
    "spec.ingress.host", "The DNS for your Mattermost installation."
    "spec.version", "The Mattermost version. Refer to :doc:`the server version archive page </about/version-archive>` when selecting a Mattermost version."

    "spec.elasticSearch.host", "Elasticsearch hostname."
    "spec.elasticSearch.username", "Username to log into Elasticsearch."
    "spec.elasticSearch.password", "Password to log into Elasticsearch."
    "spec.scheduling.resources", "Resource requests and limits of pod and container (Kubernetes)."
    "spec.scheduling.nodeSelector", "Node selector for assigning pods to nodes (Kubernetes)."
    "spec.scheduling.affinity", "Affinity and anti-affinity for assigning pods to nodes (Kubernetes)."

  More information on these additional fields can be found `in this example <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-operator/blob/master/docs/examples/mattermost_full.yaml>`__. If you have previous experience with Kubernetes Custom Resources, you can also check the `Custom Resource Definition <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-operator/blob/master/config/crd/bases/installation.mattermost.com_mattermosts.yaml>`__.

3. Create a file ``mattermost-database-secret.yaml`` to house secrets related to your installation's database. The database secret needs to be created in the namespace that will hold the Mattermost installation. The secret should contain the following data:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      DB_CONNECTION_CHECK_URL: <DB_CONNECTION_CHECK_URL>
      DB_CONNECTION_STRING: <DB_CONNECTION_STRING>
      MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCEREPLICAS: <MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCEREPLICAS>
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-postgres-connection
    type: Opaque


  .. csv-table::
    :header: "Key", "Description", "Required"

    "DB_CONNECTION_STRING", "Connection string to the database.", "Yes"
    "MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCEREPLICAS", "Connection string to read replicas of the database.", "No"
    "DB_CONNECTION_CHECK_URL", "The URL used for checking that the database is accessible.", "No"

  Here's an example of a secret for AWS Aurora with PostgreSQL:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      DB_CONNECTION_CHECK_URL: cG9zdGdyZXM6Ly91c2VyOnN1cGVyX3NlY3JldF9wYXNzd29yZEBteS1kYXRhYmFzZS5jbHVzdGVyLWFiY2QudXMtZWFzdC0xLnJkcy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tOjU0MzIvbWF0dGVybW9zdD9jb25uZWN0X3RpbWVvdXQ9MTAK
      DB_CONNECTION_STRING: cG9zdGdyZXM6Ly91c2VyOnN1cGVyX3NlY3JldF9wYXNzd29yZEBteS1kYXRhYmFzZS5jbHVzdGVyLWFiY2QudXMtZWFzdC0xLnJkcy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tOjU0MzIvbWF0dGVybW9zdD9jb25uZWN0X3RpbWVvdXQ9MTAK
      MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCEREPLICAS: cG9zdGdyZXM6Ly91c2VyOnN1cGVyX3NlY3JldF9wYXNzd29yZEBteS1kYXRhYmFzZS5jbHVzdGVyLXJvLWFiY2QudXMtZWFzdC0xLnJkcy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tOjU0MzIvbWF0dGVybW9zdD9jb25uZWN0X3RpbWVvdXQ9MTAK
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-postgres-connection
    type: Opaque

  .. note:: 

    For PostgreSQL databases, the connection is checked with `pg_isready <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/app-pg-isready.html>`__ so the ``DB_CONNECTION_CHECK_URL`` is the same as connection string.

4. Create a file ``mattermost-filestore-secret.yaml`` to house secrets related to your installation's filestore. The filestore secret needs to be created in the namespace that will hold the Mattermost installation. The secret should contain the following data:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      accesskey: <accesskey>
      secretkey: <secretkey>
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: <name>
    type: Opaque

  .. csv-table::
    :header: "Key", "Description", "Required"

    "accesskey", "Filestore access key.", "Yes"
    "secretkey", "Filestore secret key.", "Yes"
    "metadata.name", "The name of the secret.", "Yes"

  Here's an example of a secret for Amazon S3:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      accesskey: QUNDRVNTX0tFWQo=
      secretkey: U1VQRVJfU0VDUkVUX0tFWQo=
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-s3-iam-access-key
    type: Opaque

5. Adjust installation manifest.

  .. tip::
    For more information on where in the YAML structure to make the below updates, reference the supported fields in step 2.

  In order for the Mattermost Operator to utilize your external database, you must modify the Mattermost manifest (inside the ``mattermost-installation.yaml`` file) by adding the following fields:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    spec:
    ...
      database:
        external:
          secret: <secret name> # The name of the secret containing the database connection string. You set this value in step 3. Example = my-postgres-connection

  Now, point the Mattermost Operator at your external filestore. Modify the Mattermost manifest (inside the ``mattermost-installation.yaml`` file) by adding the following fields:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    spec:
    ...
      fileStore:
        external:
          url: s3.amazonaws.com
          bucket: my-s3-bucket
          secret: <secret name> # The name of the secret containing the filestore access and secret keys. You set this value in step 4. Example = my-s3-iam-access-key

  Additionally when using Amazon S3, set the ``MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SSE`` and ``MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SSL`` environment variables to ``true``:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    spec:
    ...
      mattermostEnv:
        ...
        - name: MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SSE
          value: "true"
        - name: MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SSL
          value: "true"

  If you've configured your Mattermost Enterprise Edition installation manifest with a custom PostgreSQL database, and an Amazon S3 filestore, your installation manifest should look something like this:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: installation.mattermost.com/v1beta1
    kind: Mattermost
    metadata:
      name: mm-example-external-db
    spec:
      size: 5000users
      ingress:
        enabled: true
        host: example.mattermost-example.com
        annotations:
          kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
      version: 9.3.0
      licenseSecret: my-mattermost-license
      database:
        external:
          secret: my-postgres-connection
      fileStore:
        external:
          url: s3.amazonaws.com
          bucket: my-s3-bucket
          secret: my-s3-iam-access-key
      mattermostEnv:
      - name: MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SSE
        value: "true"
      - name: MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SSL
        value: "true"

6. Apply the installation manifest file. Manifests are applied with ``kubectl``. Before running the commands make sure you are connected to your Kubernetes cluster.

  a. Create a namespace for this new Mattermost installation:

    .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl create ns mattermost

  b. (Mattermost Enterprise only) apply the license file by specifying the path to the file you created in step 1:

    .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl apply -n mattermost -f [PATH_TO_LICENCE_SECRET_MANIFEST]

  c. Apply the installation file by specifying the path to the file you created in step 2:

    .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl apply -n mattermost -f [PATH_TO_MATTERMOST_MANIFEST]

  The deployment process can be monitored in the Kubernetes user interface or in command line by running:

    .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl -n mattermost get mm -w

  The installation should be deployed successfully, when the Custom Resource reaches the ``stable`` state.

7. Configure DNS and use Mattermost.

  a. When the deployment is complete, obtain the hostname or IP address of your Mattermost deployment using the following command:

    .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl -n mattermost get ingress

  b. Copy the resulting hostname or IP address from the ``ADDRESS`` column, open your browser, and connect to Mattermost.

  c. Use your domain registration service to create a canonical name or IP address record for the ``ingress.host`` in your manifest, pointing to the address you just copied. For example, on AWS you would do this within a hosted zone in Route53.

  d. Navigate to the ``ingress.host`` URL in your browser and use Mattermost.

.. note::
  
  If you just want to try it out on your local machine without configuring the domain, run the following command, and then navigate to http://localhost:8065.

    .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl -n mattermost port-forward svc/[YOUR_MATTERMOST_NAME] 8065:8065
