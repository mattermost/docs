Installing Mattermost on Kubernetes
=========================================

This document describes installing and deploying a production-ready Mattermost system on a Kubernetes cluster using the Mattermost Kubernetes operator.

An operator is a set of product- or application-specific instructions packaged into its own program. It tells an application what to run, where to find it, and how to configure it. An operator can automate complex application deployment and operation activities, such as installation, configuration changes, software updates, failure recovery, and more.

Deploying the Mattermost Operator on Kubernetes is the recommended installation process. It provides a single common installation and management method that can be implemented in practically any environment with less IT overhead and more automation.

It is possible to manage MySQL database and MinIO file store using the Mattermost Operator, but it is not recomended for production usage.
