Production Install on RHEL 6.6
==============================

Install Mattermost in production mode on one, two or three machines, using the following steps: 

- `Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux (x64) 6.6`_
- `Set up Database Server`_
- `Set up Mattermost Server`_
- `Set up NGINX Server`_
- `Test setup and configure Mattermost Server`_

Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux (x64) 6.6
------------------------------------------

1. Set up **3 machines** with RHEL with 2GB of RAM or more. The servers will
   be used for the Proxy, Mattermost Server (must be x64), and Database.

   -  **Optional:** You can also use a **1 machine setup** (Proxy, Mattermost and Database on one machine) or a **2 machine setup** (Proxy and Mattermost on one machine, Database on another) depending on your data center standards. 

2. Make sure the system is up to date with the most recent security
   patches.

   -  ``sudo yum update``
   -  ``sudo yum upgrade``

Set up Database Server
----------------------

1.  For the purposes of this guide we will assume this server has an IP
    address of ``10.10.10.1``

    -  **Optional:** if installing on the same machine substitute
       ``10.10.10.1`` with ``127.0.0.1``

2.  Install PostgreSQL 9.4+ (or MySQL 5.6+)

    -  ``sudo yum install http://yum.postgresql.org/9.4/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-redhat94-9.4-1.noarch.rpm``
    -  ``sudo yum install postgresql94-server postgresql94-contrib``
    -  ``sudo service postgresql-9.4 initdb``
    -  ``sudo chkconfig postgresql-9.4 on``
    -  ``sudo service postgresql-9.4 start``

3.  PostgreSQL created a user account called ``postgres``. You will need
    to log into that account with:

    -  ``sudo -i -u postgres``

4.  You can get a PostgreSQL prompt by typing:

    -  ``psql``

5.  Create the Mattermost database by typing:

    -  ``postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mattermost;``

6.  Create the Mattermost user by typing:

    -  ``postgres=# CREATE USER mmuser WITH PASSWORD 'mmuser_password';``

7.  Grant the user access to the Mattermost database by typing:

    -  ``postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mattermost to mmuser;``

8.  You can exit out of PostgreSQL by typing:

    -  ``postgres=# \q``

9.  You can exit the Postgres account by typing:

    -  ``exit``

10. Allow Postgres to listen on all assigned IP Addresses:

    -  ``sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/postgresql.conf``
    -  Uncomment ``listen_addresses`` and change ``localhost`` to ``\*``

11. Alter ``pg_hba.conf`` to allow the Mattermost Server to talk to the
    Postgres database:

    -  ``sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/pg_hba.conf``
    -  Add the following line to the ``IPv4 local connections``:
    -  ``host all all 10.10.10.2/32 md5``

12. Reload Postgres database:

    -  ``sudo service postgresql-9.4 restart``

13. Attempt to connect with the new created user to verify everything
    looks good:

    -  ``psql --host=10.10.10.1 --dbname=mattermost --username=mmuser --password``
    -  ``mattermost=> \q``

Set up Mattermost Server
------------------------

1. For the purposes of this guide we will assume this server has an IP
   address of ``10.10.10.2``
2. Download `any version of the Mattermost Server <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#version-archive>`_ by typing:

   -  ``wget https://releases.mattermost.com/X.X.X/mattermost-X.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz``
   -  Where ``vX.X.X`` is typically the latest Mattermost release version, which is currently ``v3.3.0``. 
   
3. Install Mattermost under ``/opt``

   -  Unzip the Mattermost Server by typing:
   -  ``tar -xvzf mattermost-X.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz``
   -  ``sudo mv mattermost /opt``

4. Create the storage directory for files. We assume you will have
   attached a large drive for storage of images and files. For this
   setup we will assume the directory is located at
   ``/opt/mattermost/data``.

   -  Create the directory by typing:
   -  ``sudo mkdir -p /opt/mattermost/data``

5. Create a system user and group called mattermost that will run this
   service:

   -  ``sudo useradd -r mattermost -U``
   -  Set the Mattermost account as the directory owner by typing:
   -  ``sudo chown -R mattermost:mattermost /opt/mattermost``
   -  ``sudo chmod -R g+w /opt/mattermost``
   -  Add yourself to the mattermost group to ensure you can edit these
      files:
   -  ``sudo usermod -a -G mattermost USERNAME``

6. Configure Mattermost Server by editing the ``config.json`` file at
   ``/opt/mattermost/config``

   -  ``cd /opt/mattermost/config``
   -  Edit the file by typing:
   -  ``sudo vi config.json``
   -  replace ``DriverName": "mysql"`` with ``DriverName": "postgres"``
   -  replace
      ``"DataSource": "mmuser:mostest@tcp(dockerhost:3306)/mattermost_test?charset=utf8mb4,utf8"``
      with
      ``"DataSource": "postgres://mmuser:mmuser_password@10.10.10.1:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10"``
   -  Optionally you may continue to edit configuration settings in
      ``config.json`` or use the System Console described in a later
      section to finish the configuration.

7. Test the Mattermost Server

   -  ``cd /opt/mattermost/bin``
   -  Run the Mattermost Server by typing:
   -  ``sudo su mattermost``
   -  ``./platform``
   -  You should see a console log like ``Server is listening on :8065``
      letting you know the service is running.
   -  Stop the server for now by typing ``Ctrl-C``

8. Setup Mattermost to use the Upstart daemon which handles supervision
   of the Mattermost process.

   -  ``sudo touch /etc/init/mattermost.conf``
   -  ``sudo vi /etc/init/mattermost.conf``
   -  Copy the following lines into ``/etc/init/mattermost.conf``

      ::

          start on runlevel [2345]
          stop on runlevel [016]
          respawn
          limit nofile 50000 50000
          chdir /opt/mattermost
          exec bin/platform

   -  You can manage the process by typing:
   -  ``sudo start mattermost``
   -  Verify the service is running by typing:
   -  ``curl http://10.10.10.2:8065``
   -  You should see a page titles *Mattermost - Signup*
   -  You can also stop the process by running the command
      ``sudo stop mattermost``, but we will skip this step for now.

Set up NGINX Server
-------------------

1. For the purposes of this guide we will assume this server has an IP
   address of ``10.10.10.3``
2. We use NGINX for proxying request to the Mattermost Server. The main
   benefits are:

   -  SSL termination
   -  HTTP to HTTPS redirect
   -  Port mapping ``:80`` to ``:8065``
   -  Standard request logs

3. Install NGINX on RHEL with

   -  ``sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo``
   -  Copy the below into the file

   ::

       [nginx]
       name=nginx repo
       baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/rhel/6/$basearch/
       gpgcheck=0
       enabled=1

   -  ``sudo yum install nginx.x86_64``
   -  ``sudo service nginx start``
   -  ``sudo chkconfig nginx on``

4. Verify NGINX is running

   -  ``curl http://10.10.10.3``
   -  You should see a *Welcome to NGINX!* page

5. Map a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) like
   **mattermost.example.com** to point to the NGINX server.
6. Configure NGINX to proxy connections from the internet to the
   Mattermost Server

   -  Create a configuration for Mattermost
   -  ``sudo touch /etc/nginx/conf.d/mattermost.conf``
   -  Below is a sample configuration with the minimum settings required
      to configure Mattermost

     ::

          server {
          server_name mattermost.example.com;

          location / {
             client_max_body_size 50M;
             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
             proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
             proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
             proxy_set_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
             proxy_pass http://10.10.10.2:8065;
          }
        }

   - Remove the existing file with:
   - ``sudo mv /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.bak``
   - Restart NGINX by typing:
   - ``sudo service nginx restart``
   - Verify you can see Mattermost thru the proxy by typing:
   - ``curl http://localhost``
   - You should see a page titles *Mattermost - Signup*
   - Not seeing the page?  Look for errors with ``sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied``
   - **Optional** if you're running on the same server as the Mattermost server and see 502 errors you may need to run ``sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true`` because SELinux is
     preventing the connection


Set up NGINX with SSL (Recommended)
-----------------------------------

1. You can use a free and an open certificate security like `Let's
   Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_, this is how to proceed

  -  ``sudo apt-get install git``
  -  ``git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt``
  -  ``cd letsencrypt``

2. Be sure that the port 80 is not use by stopping nginx

  -  ``sudo service nginx stop``
  -  ``netstat -na | grep ':80.*LISTEN'``
  -  ``./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone``

3. This command will download packages and run the instance, after that
   you will have to give your domain name
4. You can find your certificate in ``/etc/letsencrypt/live``
5. Modify the file at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost`` and add
   the following lines:



::

     server {
     listen         80;
     server_name    mattermost.example.com;
     return         301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
  }

  server {
     listen 443 ssl;
     server_name mattermost.example.com;

     ssl on;
     ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainname/fullchain.pem;
     ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainname/privkey.pem;
     ssl_session_timeout 5m;
     ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
     ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';
     ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
     ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;

     location / {
        gzip off;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;
        client_max_body_size 50M;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
        proxy_pass http://10.10.10.2:8065;
     }
  }

6. Be sure to restart nginx
  * ``\ sudo service nginx start``
7. Add the following line to cron so the cert will renew every month
  * ``crontab -e``
  * ``@monthly /home/YOURUSERNAME/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto certonly --reinstall -d yourdomainname && sudo service nginx reload``
8. Check that your SSL certificate is set up correctly
  * Test the SSL certificate by visiting a site such as `https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html>`_
  * If there’s an error about the missing chain or certificate path, there is likely an intermediate certificate missing that needs to be included

Test setup and configure Mattermost Server
------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to ``https://mattermost.example.com`` and create a team and
   user.
2. The first user in the system is automatically granted the
   ``system_admin`` role, which gives you access to the System Console.
3. From the ``town-square`` channel click the dropdown and choose the
   ``System Console`` option
4.  Update **Notification** > **Email** settings to setup an SMTP email service. The example below assumes AmazonSES.

   -  Set *Send Email Notifications* to ``true``
   -  Set *Require Email Verification* to ``true``
   -  Set *Feedback Name* to ``No-Reply``
   -  Set *Feedback Email* to ``mattermost@example.com``
   -  Set *SMTP Username* to ``[YOUR_SMTP_USERNAME]``
   -  Set *SMTP Password* to ``[YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD]``
   -  Set *SMTP Server* to ``email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com``
   -  Set *SMTP Port* to ``465``
   -  Set *Connection Security* to ``TLS``
   -  Save the Settings

5. Update **File** > **Storage** settings:

   -  Change *Local Directory Location* from ``./data/`` to
      ``/opt/mattermost/data``

6. Update **General** > **Logging** settings:

   -  Set *Log to The Console* to ``false``

7. Update **Advanced** > **Rate Limiting** settings:

   -  Set *Vary By Remote Address* to ``false``
   -  Set *Vary By HTTP Header* to ``X-Real-IP``

8. Feel free to modify other settings
9. Restart the Mattermost Service by typing:

   -  ``sudo restart mattermost``
