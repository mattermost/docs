For MacOS it is located in ``/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/Mattermost/Data/Library/Application Support/Mattermost`` and for Windows it is located in ``Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Mattermost``.
- On Linux, a left-click on the Mattermost tray icon doesn't open the app window but opens the tray menu.
