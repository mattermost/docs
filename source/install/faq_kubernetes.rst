Frequently Asked Questions
=========================================

What is the difference between the Mattermost Operator and Helm Charts?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mattermost Operater is a self-contained set of application/product-specific instructions that runs inside Kubernetes and facilitates application
management and deployment.

Helm is a tool used to deploy Kubernetes manifests to a cluster, but does not facilitate application management.

Does the Mattermost Operator replace the Helm Chart?
----------------------------------------------------

No. Helm is a good mechanism to deploy operators and other applications but doesn't facilitate application management. 


Is minIO the only available storage option?
-------------------------------------------

No, other options and operators can be added.

Do I have to install a separate SQL server to use the Mattermost Operator?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, you can use the operator on top of your existing deployment without setting up another database. We will shortly
be providing steps for this configuration.

Can you use blue-green deployments with different database schemas?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently this is not supported as it introduces the possiblilty of missing a data entry in the database.
