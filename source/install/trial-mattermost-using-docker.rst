Troubleshooting your preview deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Preview Mode** Docker instance for Mattermost is designed for product evaluation, and sets ``SendEmailNotifications=false`` so the product can function without enabling email. See the :doc:`Configuration Settings </configure/configuration-settings>` documentation to customize your deployment.

To update your Mattermost preview image and container, you must first stop and delete your existing **mattermost-preview** container by running the following commands:

.. code:: bash

  docker pull mattermost/mattermost-preview
  docker stop mattermost-preview
  docker rm mattermost-preview

Once the new image is pulled and the container is stopped and deleted you need to run the ``docker run`` command from above.

.. important::
  On Linux, include ``sudo`` in front of all ``docker`` commands.

To access a shell inside the container, run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   docker exec -ti mattermost-preview /bin/bash
