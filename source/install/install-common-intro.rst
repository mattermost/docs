A complete Mattermost installation consists of three major components: a proxy server, a database server, and the Mattermost server. You can install all components on one machine, or you can install each component on its own machine. If you have only two machines, then install the proxy and the Mattermost server on one machine, and install the database on the other machine.

For the database, you can install either PostgreSQL or MySQL. The proxy is NGINX.

.. note::
  If you have any problems installing Mattermost, see the `troubleshooting guide </install/troubleshooting.html>`__, or `join the Mattermost user community for troubleshooting help <https://mattermost.com/pl/default-ask-mattermost-community/>`_.
