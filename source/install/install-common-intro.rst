A complete Mattermost installation consists of 3 major components: a proxy server, a database server, and the Mattermost server. You can install all components on 1 machine, or you can install each component on its own machine. If you have only 2 machines, then install the proxy and the Mattermost server on one machine, and install the database on the other machine.

For the database, you can install either MySQL or PostgreSQL. The proxy is NGINX.

.. note::
  If you have any problems installing Mattermost, see
