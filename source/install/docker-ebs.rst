    click **Next**.

       heading in the drop-down list.
    b. Set Environment Type to **Single instance** in the drop-down
       list.
    c. Click **Next**.

7.  For **Application Source**, select **Upload your own** and upload the
    Dockerrun.aws.json file from
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker/master/contrib/aws/Dockerrun.aws.json (select the
    version you'd like to use), then click **Next**.
8.  Type an Environment Name and URL. Make sure the URL is available by

    a. Select an Instance Type of **t2.small** or larger.
    b. The remaining options may be left at their default values unless

11. **Environment tags** may be left blank. Click **Next**.
12. Review your information, then click **Launch**.
13. It may take a few minutes for Beanstalk to launch your environment.
    If the launch is successful, you will see a see a large green
    checkmark and the **Health status** displays in “Green”.
14. Test your environment by clicking the domain link next to your
    application name at the top of the dashboard. Alternatively, enter
    the domain into your browser in the form of
    ``http://<your-ebs-application-url>.elasticbeanstalk.com``. You can
    also map your own domain if you wish. If everything is working
    correctly, the domain should navigate you to the Mattermost signup
    page. Enjoy exploring Mattermost!

Configuration Settings
----------------------

See `Configuration Settings <http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html>`__
documentation to customize your deployment.

(Recommended) Enable Email
--------------------------

The default Docker instance for Mattermost is designed
for product evaluation, and sets ``SendEmailNotifications=false`` so the
product can function without enabling email. To see the product's full
functionality, enabling SMTP email is recommended.
