Mattermost v7.0.0 contains medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - **IMPORTANT:** Session length configuration settings have changed from using a unit of *days* to *hours*. Instances using a config.json file or a database configuration for the following values should be automatically migrated to the new units, but instances using environment variables must make the following changes:
 1. replace `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SESSIONLENGTHWEBINDAYS` with `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SESSIONLENGTHWEBINHOURS` (x24 the value).
 2. replace `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SESSIONLENGTHMOBILEINDAYS` with `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SESSIONLENGTHMOBILEINHOURS` (x24 the value).
 3. replace `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SESSIONLENGTHSSOINDAYS` with `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SESSIONLENGTHSSOINHOURS` (x24 the value).
 - MySQL self-hosted customers may notice the migration taking longer than usual when having a large number of rows in the ``FileInfo`` table. For MySQL, it takes around 19 seconds for a table of size 700,000 rows. The time required for PostgreSQL is negligible. The testing was performed on a machine with specifications of ``CPU - Intel i7 6-cores @ 2.6 GHz`` and ``Memory - 16 GB``.
 - When a new configuration setting via **System Console > Experimental > Features > Enable App Bar** is enabled, all channel header icons registered by plugins will be moved to the new Apps Bar, even if they do not explicitly use the new registry function to render a component there. The setting for Apps Bar defaults to ``false`` for self-hosted deployments.
 - The value of ``ServiceSettings.TrustedProxyIPHeader`` defaults to empty from now on. A previous bug prevented this from happening in certain conditions. Customers are requested to check for these values in their config and set them to nil if necessary. See more details [here](/configure/configuration-settings.html#trusted-proxy-ip-header).
 - Upgrading the Microsoft Teams Calling plugin to v2.0.0 requires users to reconnect their accounts.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.7, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Collapsed Reply Threads (General Availability)
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/channels/organize-conversations.html) is now generally available. Please reference [this article](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/6880701948564) for more information and guidance for enabling the feature.

#### Calls (Beta)
 - [Native voice calling and screen sharing](/channels/make-calls.html) is now available. This is a Channels-specific integration.

#### Apps Bar (Beta)
 - Channel header is now decluttered when a new configuration setting via **System Console > Experimental > Features > Enable App Bar** is enabled, to make it more obvious how to access Calls, Playbooks, and Boards when viewing a channel. All channel header icons registered by plugins will be moved to the new Apps Bar when the configuration setting is enabled, while Calls remains in the channel header. We recommend enabling the Apps Bar for servers with Calls enabled since the Apps Bar helps make space for the dedicated **Start Call** button in the channel header.

#### Playbooks Updates
 - Users can now easily keep processes up-to-date with [the inline playbook editor](/playbooks/customize-a-playbook.html).
 - A new statistics dashboard was added that displays the number of playbooks and run instances within the server alongside other system statistics in the **System Console**.
 - Run triggers and actions now provide more control over where [status updates are posted](/playbooks/customize-a-run.html) throughout a run.

#### Message Formatting Toolbar
 - The [new formatting toolbar](/channels/format-messages.html#use-the-messaging-formatting-toolbar) makes Markdown accessible to everyone with easy to use controls for commonly used message formatting, such as bold, headings, links, and more.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - For toggling the channel information in the right-hand pane, a shortcut CTRL/CMD+ALT+I was added.
 - Added an "Unread Channels" section to the channel switcher and included threads in the results.
 - Users are no longer hidden from search results in the "Add members" modal, even if they are already members of the channel.
 - Applied new designs for the Login screen.
 - Enabled the new onboarding task list for end users.
 - The legacy **Settings > Advanced Settings > Preview Pre-release Features** setting is now deprecated in favor of the the new formatting toolbar.
 - Romanian language support was downgraded to Beta.
 
#### Performance
 - Improved the performance of aggregate queries related to Collapsed Reply Threads. Learn more about these server performance optimizations in [this article](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/6880701948564).

#### Integrations
 - To keep users in Mattermost when opening documentation links from the **System Console > Plugin** settings page, all the links now open in another tab.
 - Changed **Actions** post menu hover text to **Message Actions**.
 - Updated Apps Framework to version 1.1.0 to add improved logging.

#### Administration
 - Timestamps are now enabled in the default audit configuration.
 - The Collapsed Reply Threads configuration option was moved in the **System Console** from **Experimental** to **Site Configuration > Posts**.
 
#### Enterprise Subscription
 - Upgraded the minor version of the ElasticSearch development Docker image.
 - The Support Packet now contains two additional fields in the ``support_packet.yaml`` file: Active users and License-supported users.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue with ADA Accessibility where screen readers did not TAB to or read "This channel has guests" in the channel header bar.
 - Fixed an issue where the @mention autosuggest of users was no longer grouped by channel membership status.
 - Fixed an issue where the New Messages toast was not fully tappable in narrow view.
 - Fixed an issue where the shortcut modal for channel info showed ``ALT`` instead of ``SHIFT`` for Mac.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Help > Report a Problem** link was not hidden when a URL was not set for **System Console > Customization > Report a Problem**.
 - Fixed an issue with the timing of selector performance metrics.
 - Fixed an issue where the S3 **Test Connection** button deceptively failed unless the user pressed **Save** first.
 - Fixed an issue where Workspace Optimization did not load in the System Console on subpath servers.
 - Fixed an issue where an error was logged when ``SendEmailNotifications`` was not set to ``true``.
   
### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Changed ``SessionLengthWebInDays`` to ``SessionLengthWebInHours``.
   - Changed ``SessionLengthMobileInDays`` to ``SessionLengthMobileInHours``.
   - Changed ``SessionLengthSSOInDays`` to ``SessionLengthSSOInHours``.
   - The value of ``TrustedProxyIPHeader`` defaults to empty from now on. A previous bug prevented this from happening in certain conditions. Customers are requested to check for these values in their config and set them to nil if necessary.
   - Added ``always-on`` and ``default-on`` settings to **System Console > Posts** for Collapsed Reply Threads. When enabled (default-on), users see Collapsed Reply Threads by default and have the option to disable it in **Settings**. When always on, users are required to use Collapsed Reply Threads and can't disable it.
   - The default for ``CollapsedThreads`` has been changed to ``always_on``. This change impacts new Mattermost deployments, and doesn't affect existing configurations where this value is already set to some other value.
 - Under ``ExperimentalSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added a new config setting ``EnableAppBar`` to enable and disable the new Apps Bar. This setting is disabled by default, but we recommend enabling the Apps Bar for servers with Calls enabled since the Apps Bar helps make space for the dedicated **Start Call** button in the channel header.

#### API Changes
 - Added new API endpoints ``GET /api/v4/teams/:team_id/top/channels`` and ``GET /api/v4/users/me/top/channels`` to get top channels for a team and user.

#### Websocket Event Changes
 - Added a new ``ConnectionId`` field to ``model.WebsocketBroadcast`` that allows broadcasting a message only to a specific connection.

### Go Version
 - v7.0 is built with Go ``v1.18.1``.

### Known Issues
 - Post list doesn't always scroll down to show new messages [MM-44131](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-44131).
 - Mentions incorrectly shows users as not in a channel [MM-44157](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-44157).
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport duplicate boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.

## Release v6.7 - [Feature Release](/upgrade/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v6.7.2, released 2022-06-15**
  - Fixed an issue with Compliance Exports where the zip file creation failed when adding attachments to a post [MM-40179](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-40179).
- **v6.7.1, released 2022-06-13**
  - Mattermost v6.7.1 contains medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - The value of ``ServiceSettings.TrustedProxyIPHeader`` defaults to empty from now on. A previous bug prevented this from happening
in certain conditions. Customers are requested to check for these values in their config and set them to nil if necessary. See more details [here](/configure/configuration-settings.html#trusted-proxy-ip-header).
- **v6.7.0, released 2022-05-16**
  - Original 6.7.0 release

Mattermost v6.7.0 contains low severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Compatibility
 - Updated Chrome recommended minimum version to v100+.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - New schema changes were introduced in the form of a new index. The following summarizes the test results measuring how long it took for the database queries to run with these schema changes:
    - MySQL 7M Posts - ~17s (Instance: db.r5.xlarge)
    - MySQL 9M Posts - 2min 12s (Instance: db.r5.large)
    - Postgres 7M Posts - ~9s  (Instance: db.r5.xlarge)
 - For customers wanting a zero downtime upgrade, they are encouraged to apply this index prior to doing the upgrade. This is fully backwards compatible and will not acquire any table lock or affect any existing operations on the table when run manually. Else, the queries will run during the upgrade process and will lock the table in non-MySQL environments. Run the following to apply this index:
    - For MySQL: `CREATE INDEX idx_posts_create_at_id on Posts(CreateAt, Id) LOCK=NONE;`
    - For Postgres: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_posts_create_at_id on posts(createat, id);`

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.6, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Playbooks Updates
 - To keep procedures on track while reducing noise, task due dates can now be added to playbook runs (Professional and Enterprise subscriptions).

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added Files and Pinned Messages to the right-hand side Channel Info.
 - Improved the New Channel modal user interface.
 - Added the channel members list to the right-hand side Channel Info modal.
 - Added the ability to invite new users to a team from the **Add to channel** modal.
 - To be able to download images and copy public links for images more quickly, a copy URL and download buttons were added to image thumbnails.
 - Added the ability to have one character long channel names.
 - Pre-packaged Calls v0.4.9 with Mattermost server v6.7 (closed Beta). To participate in Beta testing, please contact [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/).
 - Updated the NPS plugin to version 1.2.0 to add a new **Give Feedback** menu item to the **Help** menu to send feedback at anytime.
 
#### Performance
 - Improved the performance of ``GetTeamsUnreadForUser`` when Collapsed Reply Threads is enabled.
 - Added an index to the ``UserGroups DisplayName`` for improved autosuggest query performance.
 - Improved the performance of permission selectors.
 - Improved the performance of configuration read/writes if the configuration is stored on a database.

#### Administration
 - To add the ability to toggle sending inactivity email notification to Admins, a configuration setting ``EmailSettings.EnableInactivityEmail`` was added.
 - To filter out inactive users in the System Console, an **Active** filter was added for users and Admins in **System Console > User Management > Users**.
 - Added a ``threadsOnly`` query parameter for getting user threads.
 - To allow Admins to add a new license without having to first remove the old one, a new “License" button was added to **System Console > Edition and License**.

#### Enterprise Subscription
 - The Elasticsearch indexing job is resumable now. Stopping a server while the job is running will put the job in pending status and will resume the job when the server starts. The job can still be explicitly canceled via the **System Console**.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where permalinks to direct and group message posts did not show a preview.
 - Fixed an issue when Collapsed Reply Threads are enabled where marking a root post with a mention as unread displayed both a mention badge and the thread item being bolded.
 - Fixed an issue where the public link to generate the API was getting called even if public links were disabled.
 - Fixed an issue with onboarding page view events.
 - Fixed an issue where the custom emoji **Next** button was out of view when a banner was present.
 - Fixed an issue where it would appear that a user had a negative number of unread threads.
 - Fixed an issue where marking the last post in a thread as unread didn't mark the thread as unread.
 - Restored the rendering of main menu items from plugins in non-mobile view.
 - Fixed the overflow of text in **Manage Channel Members** modal title.
 - Fixed an issue where pagination was broken in **System Console > Groups**.
 - Fixed an issue where thread updates did not show correctly after the computer woke up.
 - Fixed an issue where a negative unread count sometimes appeared with Collapsed Reply Threads enabled.
 - Fixed an issue where the modal to create a Custom Group got closed when pressing ENTER.
 - Fixed an issue where group mention did not get highlighted in Professional subscription.
 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to edit posts with markdown code blocks.
 - Fixed an issue where sending test (empty) notifications was allowed even when the ``SendPushNotifications`` config setting was set to ``false``.
   
### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``EmailSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``EnableInactivityEmail`` setting to be able to disable inactive server email notifications.
 - Under ``JobSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added a new cleanup job to regularly remove outdated config entries from the database. The threshold for this setting can be adjusted with ``CleanupConfigThresholdDays``.
 - Under ``ElasticsearchSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Elasticsearch (Enterprise subscription) and Bleve indexing have been revamped to be much more efficient and faster. The config parameter ``BulkIndexingTimeWindowSeconds`` for both Elasticsearch and Bleve is now deprecated and no longer used. A new config parameter called ``BatchSize`` has been introduced instead. This parameter controls the number of objects that can be indexed in a single batch. This makes things more efficient and maintains a constant workload.

#### API Changes
 - Added a new API endpoint ``POST /api/v4/users/{user_id}/teams/{team_id}/threads/{thread_id}/set_unread/{post_id}`` to set a thread as unread by post id.
 - Added new API endpoints ``GET /api/v4/teams/:team_id/top/reactions`` and ``GET /api/v4/users/me/top/reactions`` to get top reactions for a team and user.
 - Fixed an issue where the ``UpdateUser`` API endpoint required a ``create_at`` field.
 - ``api/v4/file/s3_test`` now requires ``FileSettings`` to be all set to run.
 - ``api/v4/email/test`` now requires ``EmailSettings`` to be all set to run.
 - Added ``fromWebhook`` property to the webapp plugin API.

### Go Version
 - v6.7 is built with Go ``v1.18.1``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``react-native-math-view`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile.
 - Removed ``flux`` and ``react-slidedown`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.
 - Added ``@mattermost/compass-icons``, ``bootstrap-dark``, ``fs-extra``, and ``pretty-bytes`` to https://github.com/mattermost/desktop.

### Known Issues
 - Channels with more than 100 members only show 100 members in the right-hand side [MM-44159](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-44159).
 - Shortcut modal for channel info shows ``Alt`` instead of ``Shift`` for Mac [MM-44172](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-44172).
 - A blank screen is seen when returning from the System Console while the Channel Info is open on the right-hand side [MM-44435](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-44435).
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) is currently in beta. Before enabling the feature, please ensure you are well versed in the [known issues](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues), particularly relating to database resource requirements and server performance implications. If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it's [promoted to general availability in Q2 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).
 - File upload might fail for SVG files [MM-38982](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38982).
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.

## Release v6.6 - [Feature Release](/upgrade/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v6.6.2, released 2022-06-13**
  - Mattermost v6.6.2 contains medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - The value of ``ServiceSettings.TrustedProxyIPHeader`` defaults to empty from now on. A previous bug prevented this from happening
in certain conditions. Customers are requested to check for these values in their config and set them to nil if necessary. See more details [here](/configure/configuration-settings.html#trusted-proxy-ip-header).
  - Fixed a bug that allowed to send test (empty) notifications even if the ``SendPushNotifications`` config was set to ``false``.
- **v6.6.1, released 2022-04-28**
  - Mattermost v6.6.1 contains a medium severity level security fix. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - Replaced an expired GPG key which is used to verify the enterprise binary.
  - Fixed an issue with null values in the OAuthApps table's MattermostAppID column, which was introduced in v6.6.0 [MM-43500](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-43500).
  - Fixed an issue where the Workspace Optimization dashboard mentioned that the workspace had reached over 100 users, when fewer than 100 users were registered [MM-43215](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-43215).
- **v6.6.0, released 2022-04-16**
  - Original 6.6.0 release

Mattermost v6.6.0 contains a low severity level security fix. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Compatibility
 - Updated Safari recommended minimum version to v14.1+.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - The [Apps Framework protocol](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/) for binding/form submissions has changed, by separating the single `call` into separate `submit`, `form`, `refresh` and `lookup` calls. If any users have created their own Apps, they have to be updated to the new system.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.5, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Apps Framework 1.0: General Availability
 - The [Apps Framework](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/) allows developers to build integrations with Mattermost that seamlessly work across Mattermost’s desktop and mobile clients. Apps can be developed using any programming language, as opposed to plugins which must be developed in Go.

#### Triggers and Actions
 - Channel admins can now configure [certain actions](/channels/create-channels.html) to be executed automatically based on trigger conditions without writing any code. Users running an older Playbooks release need to upgrade their Playbooks instance to at least v1.26 to take advantage of the channel actions functionality.

#### Actions Restructure
 - The **Actions** menu was restructured to reduce the clutter from Plugins and Apps.

#### Playbook Updates
 - Added [retrospective metrics](/playbooks/metrics-and-goals.html) (Enterprise edition) to track up to four key metrics that indicate performance of every run.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Pre-packaged Calls v0.4.8 with Mattermost server v6.6 (closed Beta). To participate in Beta testing, please contact [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/).
 - Added nested previews for permalinks.
 - Added a right-hand side Channel Info panel to see and interact with channel information.
 - Added support for inline editing of posts.
 - Changed the Mattermost indigo theme to match the dark theme in code blocks.
 - Updated in-product links from legacy domain about.mattermost.com to mattermost.com.
 - Made it easier to copy code blocks by adding a copy button on hover.
 - Made it easier to copy a message via a new **Copy Text** post menu item.
 - Added a loading indicator to the **Threads** global list each time more posts are fetched on infinite scroll.
 - Added search guidance to the **Threads** global list when no more posts can be loaded. This is only shown if you’ve scrolled to load older posts and reach the end of the list.
 - Added accessibility support for custom statuses.
 - Tooltip is now only displayed when text is too long in the announcement banner.
 - When restricting direct messages to users on the same team, bots are now excluded from that restriction.
 - Brazilian Portuguese language support was downgraded to Beta.
 
#### Performance
 - Improved performance when clearing notifications with Collapsed Reply Threads enabled.
 - Improved performance of Collapsed Reply Threads when ``ThreadAutoFollow`` is enabled but ``CollapsedThreads`` is disabled.
 - Fixed a potential memory leak in the sidebar when using accessibility hotkeys.
 - Virtualized the emoji picker and added other performance improvements to the emoji picker.
 - Improved the performance of storing users in webapp.
 - Fixed a small memory leak in the **System Console**.

#### Plugins
 - Updated the plugin registry's ``registerCallButtonAction`` method to allow for displaying custom calls buttons in the channel header.
 - Added a debugging setting to turn off client-side plugins for the current user.
 - Added performance metrics related to plugin loading on page load.

#### Administration
 - The default for [``ThreadAutoFollow``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#automatically-follow-threads) has been changed to ``true``. This does not affect existing configurations where this value is already set to ``false``; however, we recommend enabling ``ThreadAutoFollow`` if you plan to enable [Collapsed Reply Threads](/channels/organize-conversations.html) in the future.
 - Improved the license upload flow.
 - The Start Trial CTA presents a modal exposing the benefits the client gets by starting the trial, encouraging Admins to request a trial license and engage them with the product.
 - A new field was added to the client configuration to let clients know the database schema version of the server. The applied database migrations have also been added to the **System Console**.
 - Added a ``Automatically Follow Threads`` configuration setting to the **System Console** to expose the ``threadAutoFollow`` config setting to the User Interface.
 - An error is now shown on the email invitation modal if SMTP is not configured but email invitations are ``true``.
 - Logs from third-party libraries are now included in the default logging configuration.
 - Added additional performance debugging settings.
 - The support email field has moved from **Customization** to **Notifications** in the System Console. Also, a support email is now required when configuring email notifications.
 - The ping endpoint can now receive a device ID, which will report whether the device is able to receive push notifications.
 - [Feature flags](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/server/feature-flags/) are now automatically refreshed when the server undergoes a restart.
 - Added a sort order to the category API, and included category data in the websocket category update event.
 - Permissions for private playbooks are now hidden unless running an Enterprise license.

 - Fixed a scan error on column name "LastRootPostAt": converting NULL to int64.
 - Fixed an issue where selecting a custom status from Recent statuses used the original expiration time.
 - Fixed an issue that caused a gap to appear on the left-hand side in products using the team sidebar.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - The default for ``ThreadAutoFollow`` has been changed to ``true``. This does not affect existing configurations where this value is already set to ``false``.

### Go Version
 - v6.6 is built with Go ``v1.16.7``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``@tippyjs/react``, ``react-popper``, ``react-slidedown`` and ``smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed`` , and removed ``prettier`` and ``xregexp`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.

### Known Issues
 - On subpath, 404 can be seen on OpenID or SAML redirect after changing login method. The login change is successful, and manually adding the subpath name into the URL opens the expected page [MM-43114](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-43114).
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) is currently in beta. Before enabling the feature, please ensure you are well versed in the [known issues](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues), particularly relating to database resource requirements and server performance implications. If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it's [promoted to general availability in Q2 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).
 - File upload might fail for SVG files [MM-38982](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38982).
 - Adding an @mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the left or right arrow key can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
 - Boards are not refreshing on creation. See the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/1971) for more information.
 - Boards export and reimport duplicates boards because all IDs are replaced by new ones on the server. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues/1924) for more information.

Mattermost v6.5.0 contains low to medium severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Compatibility
 - Updated the recommended minimum supported Firefox version to v91+.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - The ``mattermost version`` CLI command does not interact with the database anymore. Therefore the database version is not going to be printed. Also, the database migrations are not going to be applied with the version sub command. [A new db migrate sub command](/manage/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-db-migrate) is added to enable administrators to trigger migrations.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.4, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Custom User Groups (Beta; Professional and Enterprise Plans)
 - Added the ability to mention a group of members at a time in a workspace. Users can create groups, edit group details, join groups, archive groups, and add group members.

#### Cross-team Channel Navigation
 - You can now find and jump to channels across all your teams by typing any channel name in the **Find Channels** modal.

#### Workspace Optimizations
 - System Admins can now review their overall health and growth scores and take recommended actions for ensuring their workspace is running smoothly, so users can get the most out of Mattermost.

#### Playbook Updates
 - Added a new onboarding tour for Playbooks.
 - Existing playbooks can now be duplicated by copying and modifying your colleague’s processes. Playbooks can also be exported.

#### Boards Updates
 - Added a new onboarding tour for Boards.

Mattermost v6.4.0 contains low severity level security fixes. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - A new schema migration system has been introduced, so we strongly recommend backing up the database before updating the server to this version. The new migration system will run through all existing migrations to record them to a new table. This will only happen for the first run in order to migrate the application to the new system. The table where migration information is stored is called ``db_migrations``. Additionally, a ``db_lock`` table is used to prevent multiple installations from running migrations in parallel. Any downtime depends on how many records the database has and whether there are missing migrations in the schema. In case of an error while applying the migrations, please check this table first. If you encounter an issue please file [an Issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues) by including the failing migration name, database driver/version, and the server logs. 
 - On MySQL, if you encounter an error "Failed to apply database migrations" when upgrading to v6.4.0, it means that there is a mismatch between the table collation and the default database collation. You can manually fix this by changing the database collation with ``ALTER DATABASE <YOUR_DB_NAME> COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_general_ci',``. Then do the server upgrade again and the migration will be successful. 
 - It has been commonly observed on MySQL 8+ systems to have an error ``Error 1267: Illegal mix of collations`` when upgrading due to changing the default collation. This is caused by the database and the tables having different collations. If you get this error, please change the collations to have the same value with, for example, ``ALTER DATABASE <db_name> COLLATE = '<collation>'``.
 - The new migration system requires the MySQL database user to have additional *EXECUTE*, *CREATE ROUTINE*, *ALTER ROUTINE* and *REFERENCES* privileges to run schema migrations.                   

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.3, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Playbook Updates
 - The Team and Starter plans no longer have a limit to the number of playbooks that can be created.

#### Boards Updates
 - Redesigned the Boards template selector to help users find the best template for projects.
 - Board archives now support images. All image attachments on cards will be included the next time a board archive is exported and imported. The archive format is changing with a new ``.boardarchive`` extension and all new exports will only be in this format.
 - Added card badges to indicate the type of content in a card, such as the description, comments, and checklists, without needing to open the card.
 - The entire text on URL properties is now clickable, so users can easily open links from a card without needing to click on a small link icon.
 - GIF file types are now supported as image attachments in card descriptions.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 -  [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html), available in beta, are known to have a negative impact on server performance. If you cannot easily scale up and tune your database, or if you are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended disabling [``ThreadAutoFollow``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#automatically-follow-threads) and [``CollapsedThreads``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#collapsed-reply-threads-beta) until Collapsed Reply Threads is promoted to general availability in Q2 2022. Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 -  Channel results in the channel autocomplete will include private channels. Customers using [Bleve](/deploy/bleve-search.html) or [Elasticsearch](/scale/elasticsearch.html) for autocomplete will have to reindex their data to get the new results. Since this can take a long time, we suggest disabling autocomplete and running indexing in the background. When this is complete, re-enable autocomplete. Note that only channel members will see private channel names in autocomplete results.
 -  [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html), available in beta, are known to have a negative impact on server performance. If you cannot easily scale up and tune your database, or if you are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended disabling [``ThreadAutoFollow``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#automatically-follow-threads) and [``CollapsedThreads``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#collapsed-reply-threads-beta) until Collapsed Reply Threads is promoted to general availability in Q2 2022. Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Please refer to [the schema migration analysis](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/997b726a86b5d2a624ac2af435a66086) when upgrading to v6.1.
 - The Bleve index has been updated to use the scorch index type. This new default index type features some efficiency improvements which means that the indexes use significantly less disk space. To use this new type of index, after upgrading the server version, run a purge operation and then a reindex from the Bleve section of the System Console. Bleve is still compatible with the old indexes, so the currently indexed data will work fine if the purge and reindex is not run.
 - A composite index has been added to the jobs table for better query performance. For some customers with a large jobs table, this can take a long time, so we recommend adding the index during off-hours, and then running the migration. A table with more than 1 million rows can be considered as large enough to be updated prior to the upgrade.
   - For PostgreSQL: ``create index concurrently idx_jobs_status_type on jobs (status,type);``
   - For MySQL: ``create index idx_jobs_status_type on Jobs (Status,Type);``
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html), available in beta, are known to have a negative impact on server performance. If you cannot easily scale up and tune your database, or if you are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended disabling [``ThreadAutoFollow``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#automatically-follow-threads) and [``CollapsedThreads``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#collapsed-reply-threads-beta) until Collapsed Reply Threads is promoted to general availability in Q2 2022. Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v6.0, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``EnableInlineLatex`` to add support for inline Latex rendering.
 - Under ``JobSettings`` in ``config.json``
   - Added ``CleanupJobsThresholdDays``. This defines the time gap in days beyond which older jobs will be removed. Default is -1 which means the feature is disabled. Setting to 0 will clean all completed jobs.
   
#### Database Changes
 - Extended the maximum size to 256 characters for the following database columns:
    - ``Sessions.Roles``
    - ``ChannelMembers.Roles``
    - ``TeamMembers.Roles``

### API Changes
 - Added a new API endpoint ``POST /api/v4/posts/search`` to perform searches across all channels.
 
### Go Version
 - v6.1 is built with Go ``v1.16.7``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``fast-deep-equal``, ``luxon``, and ``react-window-infinite-loader`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.
 - Added ``@mattermost/react-native-paste-input`` to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile.

### Known Issues
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) is currently in beta. Before enabling the feature, please ensure you are well versed in the [known issues](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues),  particularly relating to database resource requirements and server performance implications. If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it's [promoted to general availability in Q2 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga/). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).
 - Created permalinks from saved posts do not correctly redirect to the correct team [MM-39816](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-39816).
 - Recent Mentions search sometimes includes incorrect results [MM-39867](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-39867).
 - Experimental timezones and custom statuses can cause an increase in CPU usage and database connections for servers with an E20 license. A current workaround is to disable custom statuses or to disable experimental timezones.
 - Webapp sometimes crashes when clicking an image from "Recent files" [MM-38239](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38239).
 - Member type is missing from autocomplete [MM-38989](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38989).
 - File upload might fail for SVG files [MM-38982](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38982).
 - ``Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+A`` shortcut does not open **Account Settings** [MM-38236](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38236).
 - Adding an at-mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the leftwards or rightwards arrow can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.

### Deprecations

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](/manage/command-line-tools.html). Most commands have been replaced by [mmctl](/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a robust replacement.

2. [Slack Import via the web app](/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu has been replaced by the [mmetl](/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.12. Minimum support is now for 5.7.12+. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 is Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We no longer provide support for Mattermost Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFAEndpoint](/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting. The config setting is removed and the feature is promoted to general availability.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The deprecated settings include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental) (Please see [channel moderation settings](/onboard/advanced-permissions.html#read-only-channels), which allow you to set any channel as read-only, including Town Square) 
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](/configure/configuration-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](/configure/configuration-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](/configure/configuration-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](/configure/configuration-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

### Important Upgrade Notes

 - Longer migration times can be expected. See [this document](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/59b3582118913d4fc5e8ff81ea78b055) for the estimated upgrade times with datasets of 10+ million posts. See [this document](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/868c451164f6e8069d8b398685a31b6e) for the estimated upgrade times with datasets of 70+ million posts. The field type of Data in model.ClusterMessage was changed to []byte from string. Therefore, a major thing to note is that a v6 server is incompatible to run along with a v5 server in a cluster. Customers upgrading from 5.x to 6.x cannot do a High Availability upgrade. While upgrading, it is required that no other v5 server runs when a v6 server is brought up. A v6 server will run significant database schema changes that can cause a large startup time depending on the dataset size. Zero downtime will not be possible, but depending on the efforts made during the migration process, it can be minimized to a large extent. It is recommended to start Mattermost directly and not through systemctl to avoid the server process getting killed during the migration. This can happen since the value of ``TimeoutStartSec`` in the provided systemctl service file is set to 1 hour. Customers using the Mattermost Kubernetes operator should be aware of the above migration information and choose the path that is most appropriate for them. If (1) is acceptable, then the normal upgrade process using the operator will suffice. For minimum downtime, follow (2) before using the operator to update Mattermost following the normal upgrade process.
   1. Low effort, long downtime - This is the usual process of starting a v6 server normally. This has 2 implications: during the migration process, various tables will be locked which will render those tables read-only during that period. Secondly, once the server finishes migration and starts the application, no other v5 server can run in the cluster.
   2. Medium effort, medium downtime - This process will require SQL queries to be executed manually on the server. To avoid causing a table lock, a customer can choose to use the pt-online-schema-change tool for MySQL. For Postgres, the table locking is very minimal. The advantage is that since there are a lot of queries, the customer can take their own time to run individual queries during off-hours. All queries except #11 are safe to be executed this way. Then the usual method of (1) can be followed.
   3. High effort, low downtime - This process requires everything of (2), plus it tries to minimize the impact of query #11. We can do this by following step 2, and then starting v6 along with a running v5 server, and then monitor the application logs. As soon as the v6 application starts up, we need to bring down a v5 node. This minimizes the downtime to only a few seconds.
 - While trying to upgrade to a Mattermost version >= 6.0.x, you might encounter the following error: ``Failed to alter column type. It is likely you have invalid JSON values in the column. Please fix the values manually and run the migration again.`` This means that the particular column has some invalid JSON values which need to be fixed manually. A common fix that is known to work is to wipe out all \u0000 characters. Please follow these steps:
   1. Check the affected values by: ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE '%\u0000%';``
   2. If you get a count more than 0, check those values manually, and confirm they are okay to be removed.
   3. Remove them by ``UPDATE <table> SET <column> = regexp_replace(<column>, '\\u0000', '', 'g') where <column> like '%\u0000%';``
   4. Then try to start Mattermost again.
 - Focalboard plugin has been renamed to Mattermost Boards, and v0.9.1 (released with Mattermost v6.0) is now enabled by default.
 - The advanced logging configuration schema changed. This is a breaking change relative to 5.x. See updated [documentation](/comply/audit-log.html).
 - Some breaking changes to plugins are included:
   - Support for left-hand side-specific bot icons was dropped.
   - Removed a deprecated "Backend" field from the plugin manifest.
   - Converted the "Executables" field in the plugin manifest to a map.
 -  [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html), available in beta, are known to have a negative impact on server performance. If you cannot easily scale up and tune your database, or if you are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended disabling [``ThreadAutoFollow``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#automatically-follow-threads) and [``CollapsedThreads``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#collapsed-reply-threads-beta) until Collapsed Reply Threads is promoted to general availability in Q2 2022. Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.39, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Multi-Product Platform
 - Mattermost now ships as one platform with three products - Channels, Playbooks, and Boards.
 - Playbooks and Boards are visible when [plugins are enabled system-wide](/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-plugins). 

#### Global Product Launcher
 - Added a global header for product navigation for Channels, Playbooks, and Boards. This is disabled on the mobile web view and mobile apps.

#### Branding Changes
 - Added a new default brand theme named "Denim".
 - The existing theme names and colors, including "Mattermost", "Organization", "Mattermost Dark", and "Windows Dark" have been updated to the new "Denim", "Sapphire", "Quartz", "Indigo", and "Onyx" theme names and colors, respectively. Anyone using the existing themes will see slightly modified theme colors after their server or workspace is upgraded. The theme variables for the existing "Mattermost", "Organization", "Mattermost Dark", and "Windows Dark" themes will still be accessible in [our documentation](/messaging/customizing-theme-colors.html#custom-theme-examples), so a custom theme can be created with these theme variables if desired. Custom themes are unaffected by this change.
 - Added a new light theme named "Quartz" to the default available list of themes.
 - Updated email templates to the new branding.

#### Packaging Changes
 - Updated in-product strings referencing E10 & E20 to [new packaging](https://mattermost.com/pricing).
 - Features moved from legacy E10 to all plans, including Team Edition:
   - System default permissions, e.g. permission to create and archive channels system-wide.
      - Specifically, “System Scheme” only in **System Console > User Management > Permissions**. 
      - Existing permissions/policies in TE/E0 for "Enable Team Creation" and "Allow Team Administrators to edit others’ posts" are properly handled. 
   - Team and Channel management pages (but without channel moderation, e.g. read-only channels).
 - Features moved from legacy E20 to Professional plan:
   - SSO with OpenID Connect, SAML, Google and O365
   - O365 integrations including MS Teams Calling and MS Calendar
   - Jira multi-server support
   - Advanced team permissions
   - Channel moderation
 - E20, Professional, and Enterprise license SKUs are now supported for installing Enterprise plugins.

#### Beta features Promoted to General Availability
   - Archived channels
   - Compliance exports
   - Custom terms of service
   - Guest accounts
   - System roles
   - Plugins

#### Permalink Previews
 - Added support for permalink previews for posts in Mattermost. Previews are generated to minimize context switching when sharing message links in Channels.

#### Tutorial Updates
 - Added a tip to the **Getting Started** page for downloading Desktop Apps.
 - Updated tutorial icons and changed text content in tutorial tips.
 - Updated the default treatment for the ``Add channel`` button to the current color and by team name.
 - Added a tutorial tip for new settings and status buttons.
 - Added a tip for the product switcher. This tip is skipped if not applicable.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added “Invite People” to the main "+" button below the hamburger menu.
 - The whole category bounds are now highlighted while holding a channel above a category name on the left-hand side.
 - Updated **Account Settings > Display > Timezone** to be more user friendly.
 - New theme agnostic file preview modal takes up the full screen. The file preview now has information about the user, channel, and the file, and moves away from text-based buttons to icon-based buttons.
 - Increased the limit of uploaded file attachments per post from 5 to 10.
 - Added desktop notifications for followed Threads.
 - Hungarian and English-Australian are now official languages.
 - Added a **Start Trial** call-to action to the **Main Menu**.
 - Changed H1-H3 heading font from Open Sans to Metropolis.

#### Performance
 - Improved typing performance when the emoji autocomplete is open.
 - Added performance improvements for draft storage with multiple tabs open.
 - Improved performance of draft loading.

#### Integrations
 - Pre-packaged Channel Export plugin v1.0.0.
 - Added a "rest field" to the App command parser.
 - Added support for React components in channel header tooltips registered by plugins.
 - Exported ``ChannelInviteModal`` and ``ChannelMembersModal`` components for plugins.

#### Administration
 - Added ``playbooks`` and ``boards`` to restricted team URLs list. Conflict exists if users hit the URL to the team directly without the trailing channel, permalink or threads information (ie server/team) and they have a team name “playbooks” or “boards”. User would expect to be taken to their messaging team.  
 - Added the ability for Team Edition to edit role permissions.
 - Removed a hard-coded override of ``TeamSettings.MaxNotificationsPerChannel`` on unlicensed servers (e.g. Team Edition).
 - Migrated the extraction command to mmctl.
 - Removed the convert channel endpoint to use ``/channels/{channel_id}/privacy`` instead.
 - Removed deprecated ``Posts.ParentId`` in favor of the semantically equivalent ``Posts.RootId``. Also removed ``CommandWebhook.ParentId`` and ``CompliancePost.ParentId`` for the same reason.
 - Added a field to each of the compliance export formats (CSV, Global Relay, and Actiance) to indicate that a post was viewable via the new permalink preview feature.
 - Removed the following deprecated CLI commands in favor of [mmctl](/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html):
   - channel
   - command
   - config
   - extract
   - group
   - integrity
   - ldap
   - license
   - logs
   - permissions
   - plugin
   - reset
   - roles
   - sampledata
   - team
   - user
   - webhook

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue with Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta) where replying to a Thread caused users to re-follow the previously unfollowed Thread.
 - Fixed an issue where floating timestamps appeared incorrectly on the right-hand side with Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta) enabled.
 - Fixed an issue where pinned and saved posts were no longer highlighted.
 - Disabled admin support email status check job on server startup.
 - Fixed an issue on joining a missing channel as a System Admin.
 - Fixed import process for imports with attachments.
 - Fixed an error with app locations and binding filtering.

### Database Changes
 - Added the following database indexes:
   - ``idx_posts_root_id_delete_at_create_at``
   - ``idx_channels_team_id_display_name``
   - ``idx_channels_team_id_type``
   - ``idx_threads_channel_id_last_reply_at``
   - ``idx_channelmembers_user_id_channel_id_last_viewed_at``

If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it is [promoted to general availability in Q2 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga/). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).
 - Webapp sometimes crashes when clicking an image from "Recent files" [MM-38239](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38239).

### Go Version
 - v5.39 is built with Go ``1.16.7``.

### Upcoming Deprecations in Mattermost v6.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v6.0 release, which is scheduled for 2021/10/13. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](/manage/command-line-tools.html). All commands have been fully replaced by [mmctl](/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a full and robust replacement. 

2. [Slack Import via the web app](/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu is being replaced by the [mmetl](/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.7. Minimum support will now be for 5.7.12. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 will be Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We will no longer provide support for Mattermost Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFAEndpoint](/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting. The config setting will be removed and the feature will be promoted to general availability.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The settings being deprecated include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](/configure/configuration-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](/configure/configuration-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](/configure/configuration-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](/configure/configuration-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](/configure/configuration-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](/configure/configuration-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

### Known Issues
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) is currently in beta. Before enabling the feature, please ensure you are well versed in the [known issues](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues),  particularly relating to database resource requirements and server performance implications. If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it is [promoted to general availability in Q2 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga/). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).
 - Experimental timezones and custom statuses can cause an increase in CPU usage and database connections for servers with an E20 license. A current workaround is to disable custom statuses or to disable experimental timezones.
 - Adding an at-mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the leftwards or rightwards arrow can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Pinned posts are no longer highlighted [MM-34870](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34870).
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.
 - The team sidebar on the desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.

## Release v5.38 - [Feature Release](/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v5.38.4, released 2021-11-15**
  - Mattermost v5.38.4 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
- **v5.38.3, released 2021-10-27**
  - Mattermost v5.38.3 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).
  - Fixed a race condition in telemetry IDs on High Availability servers [MM-39343](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-39343).
- **v5.38.2, released 2021-08-26**
  - Upgraded Go version to 1.16.7 to fix an application crash issue.
  - Fixed an issue where mmctl ``config reload`` command was missing local-mode server-side implementation. [MM-38082](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-38082)
- **v5.38.1, released 2021-08-18**
  - Fixed an issue where Playbooks v1.16.0 could not be installed as a pre-packaged plugin [MM-37928](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-37928).
- **v5.38.0, released 2021-08-16**
  - Original 5.38.0 release

Mattermost v5.38.0 contains low to medium level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).

### Deprecations
 - The “config watcher” (the mechanism that automatically reloads the ``config.json`` file) has been removed in favor of the ``mmctl config reload`` command, which must be run to apply configuration changes after they are made on disk. This change improves configuration performance and robustness.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - v5.38 adds fixes for some of the incorrect mention counts and unreads around threads and channels since the introduction of Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta). This fix is done through a SQL migration, and it may take several minutes to complete for large databases. The ``fixCRTChannelMembershipCounts`` fix takes 1 minute and 20 seconds for a database containing approximately 4 million channel memberships and about 130,000 channels. The ``fixCRTThreadCountsAndUnreads`` fix takes about 3 minutes and 30 seconds for a database containing 56367 threads, 124587 thread memberships, and 220801 channel memberships. These are on MySQL v5.6.51.
 - Focalboard v0.8.2 (released with Mattermost v5.38.0) requires Mattermost v5.37+ due to the new database connection system.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.37, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Granular Data Retention Policies (Enterprise E20)
 - A ``data_retention`` type job can now be run even if the global policy is disabled. The granular (i.e. team and channel-specific) policies will be executed when the data retention job is run. Please note there is a known issue where deleted posts get displayed in channels without new activity after the retention job is run.  This issue is tracked with [this ticket](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-36574).

#### Enhanced User Onboarding Experience
 - To help new users get started with Mattermost, new Getting Started steps have been added to the onboarding experience. These steps help users to complete their profile, name their teams, configure desktop notifications, and invite others to join their team. Additionally, once the onboarding is complete, users are provided with helpful tips to get started with channels, plugins, and more.

#### Playbooks Updates
 - ``Incident Collaboration`` was rebranded to ``Playbooks``. Also the channel right-hand sidebar is redesigned, our own playbooks are shared as templates, and more triggers and actions were added.

#### Focalboard Updates
 - Added created-by property and improved performance with shared database connections. Focalboard 0.8.2 requires Mattermost v5.37+ due to a new database connection system.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Upgraded German language back to an official language.
 - Markdown formatting is now stripped from push notifications.
 - Enabled the **Set Status** button if the custom status hasn't changed from currently set status.
 - Improved default rendering of images inserted via the GIF picker.
 - Small text changes were added to Direct and Group Message menus: **Mute channel** and **Edit Channel Header** now reads as **Mute Conversation** and **Edit Conversation Header**.

#### Performance
 - Improved performance of components that show reactions on posts.
 - Improved performance of certain components when viewing non-Direct Message channels.
 - Added minor improvements to performance of messages posted in the right-hand side.
 - Improved typing performance in affected environments by reducing the frequency in which drafts are saved.

#### Integrations
 - Added icons to apps in the Marketplace.
 - Apps can now add arbitrary markdown in between fields on forms.
 - Added support for markdown in apps forms, interactive dialogs field descriptions, errors, and slash commands.
 - Improved user and channel selector for app commands.
 - Added support for ``react-intl`` and ``<Timestamp/>`` usage in plugins.
 - Added plugin API methods for user access tokens and OAuth apps.

#### Administration
 - Added a new feature to archive and unarchive teams through **System Console** > **Teams**.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue where inter-plugin requests without a body didn't work.
 - Fixed an issue with opening a dialog from an interactive message when returning an empty response.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Add Members** modal was incorrectly themed on the Mattermost Dark Theme.
 - Fixed a panic in the ``getPrevTrialLicense`` API request when loading the System Console on Team Edition.

   - Fixed an issue where an error occurred while following a thread with no replies.
   - Fixed an issue where ``reply_count`` of 0 was always returned for GET single Post on ``/posts/<postid>`` API.
   - Fixed an issue where following a single message returned a status 500.
   - Fixed an issue where when replying in a thread after unfollowing it, the thread was not auto-followed again.
   - Fixed an issue where when enabling Collapsed Reply Threads, channels that had no new activity were showing as unread.
   - Fixed an issue with thread unreads when the feature was enabled by a user.
   - Fixed an issue where self replies were marking threads as unread.
   - Unread threads are now correctly displayed on app load for teams in the sidebar when Collapsed Reply Threads feature is enabled.
   - Fixed an issue where "Thread" in the thread viewer was displayed vertically in some languages.
   - Fixed an issue where opening global threads containing a root post markdown image crashed the app.
   - Fixed an issue where the app crashed when switching to the Threads view after leaving a channel.
   - Fixed an issue where replying to a thread from the global threads screen marked the channel as read.
   - The **Mark all as unread** button is now no longer disabled for Collapsed Reply Threads.
   - Fixed root posts not being shown as followed for the post creator after receiving the first reply that affected servers with Collapsed Reply Threads enabled and database read replicas configured.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``PluginSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``ChimeraOAuthProxyURL`` to allow specifying Chimera URL that can be used by plugins to connect with pre-created OAuth applications.
 - The config setting ``EnableReliableWebSockets`` now defaults to ``true``.

### API Changes
 - Added ``CreateChannelSidebarCategory``, ``GetChannelSidebarCategories`` and ``UpdateChannelSidebarCategories`` to the Plugin API.
 - Add a new Plugin API method that allows files to register dropdown menu actions.

### Deprecations
 - The ``platform`` binary and “--platform” flag have been removed. If you are using the “--platform” flag or are using the ``platform`` binary directly to run the Mattermost server application via a systemd file or custom script, you will be required to use only the mattermost binary.

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-beta/) are available as beta in Mattermost Server v5.37 and later. It’s expected that you may experience bugs as we stabilize the feature. In particular, please be aware of [the known issues documented here](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues).
 - v5.37 adds support for emoji standard v13.0. If you have added a custom emoji in the past that uses one of the new system names, then that custom emoji is going to get overwritten by the system emoji. The workaround is to change the custom emoji name.
 - Parts of Incident Collaboration are now available to all Mattermost editions. As part of this update, Incident Collaboration will require a minimum server version of v5.37. To learn more about what is available in each edition, visit [our pricing page](https://mattermost.com/pricing-self-managed/).
 - Support for Mattermost Server v5.31 [Extended Support Release](/administration/extended-support-release.html) will come to the end of its life cycle on October 15, 2021. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v5.37 or later is required.
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html), available in beta, are known to have a negative impact on server performance. If you cannot easily scale up and tune your database, or if you are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended disabling [``ThreadAutoFollow``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#automatically-follow-threads) and [``CollapsedThreads``](/configure/configuration-settings.html#collapsed-reply-threads-beta) until Collapsed Reply Threads is promoted to general availability in Q2 2022. Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.36, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta)
 - We're excited to give you early access to Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta). It can be enabled in the **System Console > Experimental > Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta)**. Learn more about the features and known issues in [our documentation](/help/messaging/organizing-conversations.html).

#### Emoji Enhancements with Skin Tone Selection
 - Added support for emoji standard v13.0. Users now have the ability to choose various skin tones using the Mattermost emoji picker. Mobile support is included in v1.45 Mobile App release (July 16th).

#### Improved Enterprise Trial Experience (Enterprise Editions E0, E10, E20)
 - After a Self-Managed trial ends, admins can optionally contact sales or make a purchase in a single click.

#### Focalboard: Grouped Table view, New properties, and More (Beta)
 - Focalboard tables can now be grouped by a property, for example allowing you to quickly see tasks per epic or owner.

#### Incident Collaboration Updates
 - The update includes availability on all editions, playbook keyword monitoring, retrospective report, and playbook dashboard.

#### English-Australian Language Support
 - Mattermost is now available in English-Australian.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - In the at-mention autocomplete, the user’s nickname is no longer shown when (you) is present.
 - Updated the help text on the **Add Users** channel modal.
 - Added the ability to upload ``.jpeg`` files on Linux. Uploading ``.jpg`` files was already supported.
 - The **Channel Switcher** now displays recently viewed channels when launched.
 - Polish, German, and Italian languages were downgraded to beta as they are [no longer actively maintained](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/localization#translation-quality).
 - Custom statuses can now be set to expire after common time intervals or custom selected dates and times. Mobile App support will be added in a future release.

#### Performance
 - Added some improvements to typing performance.

#### Administration
 - Improved memory performance for large image uploads, particularly PNGs with transparency.
 - Optimized the bulk import process by no longer requiring the server to write the incoming archive to the filesystem when unzipping it.
 - Added channel restore and channel privacy change endpoints to the local mode using the System bot.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to set a custom status emoji via slash command. Added the logic for detecting unicode emoji and setting it as a custom status emoji via slash commands.
 - Fixed an issue where messages with fallback text were repeated.
 - Fixed an issue where a persistent unread badge showed on the **Main Menu** when **Enable Marketplace** or **Enable Plugins** was disabled.
 - Fixed an issue where sidebar icons were not aligned with the navigator area icons.
 - Fixed an issue where using CTRL+F in a **Direct Message** channel added the user ID rather than the user's name into the search field.
 - Fixed an issue where user icons were displayed at full opacity in muted channels.
 - Fixed an issue where a redundant ``user_update`` websocket event was generated for bot users.
 - Fixed an issue where a Self-Managed Enterprise Edition E20 trial could be activated more than once without contacting the Mattermost support team.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``CollapsedThreads`` to add support for Collapsed Reply Threads (Beta).

#### Database Changes
 - Removed several redundant Database indexes.

### API Changes
 - Added a new field, team_id, to the response of ``POST api/v4/groups/{group_id}/channels/{channel_id}/link`` to add a team ID to the response when linking a channel to a group.
 - Added an optional ``collapsed_threads_supported`` parameter to /channels/members/{userId}/view to indicate that the client supports collapsed threads.
 - Added an optional ``collapsed_threads_supported`` parameter to /users/{userId}/posts/{postId}/set_unread to indicate that the client supports collapsed threads.
 - Updated the webapp to pass ``collapsed_threads_supported`` parameters to the server to indicate that the webapp supports collapsed reply threads.
 - Updated the webapp to correctly mark channels and threads as unread/read when marking root and reply posts as unread/read.
 - Added a new endpoint ``GET /trial-license/prev`` for fetching last used trial license.
 - Added two new fields in ``CustomStatus`` struct and modified the APIs to validate and handle them.

### Go Version
 - v5.37 is built with Go ``1.15.5``.

### Open Source Components

### Upcoming Deprecations in Mattermost v6.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v6.0 release, which is scheduled for 2021/10/15. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](/administration/command-line-tools.html). All commands have been fully replaced by [mmctl](/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a full and robust replacement. 

2. [Slack Import via the web app](/administration/migrating.html?highlight=mmetl#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu is being replaced by the [mmetl](/administration/migrating.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.7. Minimum support will now be for 5.7.12. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 will be Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We will no longer provide support for the Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFA](/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The settings being deprecated include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](/administration/config-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](/administration/config-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](/administration/config-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](/administration/config-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](/administration/config-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](/administration/config-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](/administration/config-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](/administration/config-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

### Known Issues
 - [Collapsed Reply Threads](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) is currently in beta. Before enabling the feature, please ensure you are well versed in the [known issues](/messaging/organizing-conversations.html#known-issues),  particularly relating to database resource requirements and server performance implications. If you cannot easily scale up your database size, or are running the Mattermost application server and database server on the same machine, we recommended waiting to enable Collapsed Reply Threads until it is [promoted to general availability in Q2 2022](https://mattermost.com/blog/collapsed-reply-threads-ga/). Learn more about these [performance considerations here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413183568276).
 - When upgrading to 5.37.0, the Incident Collaboration plugin may not be automatically installed in some cases.
 - Add Members modal is incorrectly themed on the Mattermost Dark theme [MM-37220](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-37220).

 - Adding an at-mention at the start of a post draft and pressing the leftwards or rightwards arrow can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - Emoji counter in the center channel doesn't always update immediately when a reaction is added in the right-hand side [MM-31994](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-31994).
 - Fields on the right column in a message attachment render unevenly [MM-36943](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-36943).
 - Pinned posts are no longer highlighted.
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as **Away** or **Offline** in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotation marks with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.

 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.

  - Original 5.36.0 release

Mattermost v5.36.0 contains a high level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Gossip clustering mode is now in General Availability and is no longer available as an option. All cluster traffic will always use the gossip protocol. The config setting ``UseExperimentalGossip`` has no effect and has only been kept for compatibility purposes. The setting to use gossip has been removed from the System Console. **Note:** For High Availability upgrades, all nodes in the cluster must use a single protocol. If an existing system is not currently using gossip, one node in a cluster can't be upgraded while other nodes in the cluster use an older version. Customers must either use gossip for their High Availability upgrade, or customers must shut down all nodes, perform the upgrade, and then bring all nodes back up.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.35, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Focalboard (Beta)
 - Focalboard is now integrated with Mattermost as a beta feature in v5.36. To enable Focalboard, open the Marketplace from the sidebar menu, install the Focalboard plugin, then click on **Configure**, enable it, and save. Update your NGINX or Apache web proxy config following [these steps](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/566).

#### Incident Collaboration (Enterprise Edition E20)
 - Includes automated welcome message, team-wide playbook access, and permission control for playbook creation.

#### Hungarian Language Support (Beta)
 - Mattermost is now available in Hungarian.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - If message autoresponder is set, only one message is now sent to a given user irrespective of how many Direct Message messages the user receives.
 - Added status icons on **Add members** to channel and **Add members** to team lists.
 - Added a keyboard shortcut to focus on the Search bar and search in the current channel.
 - A search tip is now shown when scrolling back in a channel.
 - Improved the error text in the **Edit Channel Header** modal.
 - Added the ability to clear a custom status when only an emoji and no text is set.
 - Redesigned message notification emails.
 - When **Show online availability on profile images** is set to **Off**, the online status icon is hidden from the profile image in the center channel and the right-hand side view.

#### Performance
 - Added a performance improvement to the emoji picker overlay to improve typing performance.
 - Added performance improvements when receiving new posts.

#### Administration
 - ``TCP_NO_DELAY`` is disabled for Websocket connections to allow for higher throughput.
 - Compliance Monitoring CSV files are no longer limited to 30,000 rows.
 - The default value of the [Support Email](/administration/config-settings.html#support-email) (previously ``_feedback@mattermost.com_``) has been removed. Admin Advisor will now prompt System Admins about missing configuration for the [Support Email](/administration/config-settings.html#support-email). This value is required, and it ensures Mattermost account requests are sent to the correct team for resolution.
 - The **Marketplace** button in the **Main Menu** is now displayed if the user has the ``sysconsole_write_plugins`` permission.
 - Added new feature discoveries in the System Console, including Data Retention Policy and OpenID Connect.
 - Added basic intra-cluster communication support for plugins.
 - Improved error messages for ``/header`` and ``/purpose`` commands.
 - Team-restricted direct channel creation is now also applied to the backend. Previously, this was restricted to the frontend.
 - Refactored the config storing logic to improve its robustness and performance.
 - Added a visual grouping of related settings under AD/LDAP in the System Console.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where bulk export generated invalid Direct Message channels between deactivated users.
 - Fixed an issue where the custom status cleared slash commands on mobile.
 - Fixed an issue with an incorrect error message when trying to change handle via API to another one that already existed.
 - Fixed an issue where LDAP Group Sync didn't work when using SAML (ADFS) for authentication and AD/LDAP Group Sync unless ``EnableSyncWithLdapIncludeAuth`` was set to ``true``, which caused the ``AuthData`` to be stored in AD/LDAP format.
 - Fixed an issue where a user with 'No Access' permission could still access **Groups**, **Channels** and **Teams** configuration pages through a URL.
 - Fixed an issue where **Remove from channel** and **Remove Team Member** menu items were visible in a group-synced channel or team.
 - Fixed various bugs related to hardcoded theme colours.
 - Fixed UI issues related to hardcoded variables and misalignment of the channel header with the **Has guests** text.
 - Fixed an issue with SAML Sign-on where System Admins were unable to modify **Service Provider Login URL** unless ``VerifySignature`` was enabled.
 - Fixed a race condition where enabling plugins would result in spurious errors in the logs.
 - Fixed a bug where team member permissions were not updated after associating a team with a permission scheme.
 - Fixed the responses of the role by ID and all roles of API endpoints when the role was associated to channel schemes.
 - Removed sticky sidebar headings in favor of fixing nesting errors.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Close** button in the **Create New Category** modal was only visible on mouse hover.
 - Fixed a bug where session expiration was extended with activity regardless of what the config setting ``ServiceSettings.ExtendSessionLengthWithActivity`` was set to.
 - Fixed an issue where the ``idmigrate`` command did not update values if they were not already present as LDAP attributes in the ``config.json``.
 - Fixed an issue where the job scheduler server could miss a "changed leader" cluster event.
 - Fixed an issue where using ``Ctrl+Cmd+F`` on the MacOS Desktop App opened the search instead of full-screened the app.
 - Fixed an issue where the message input box was shadowed when uploading a file in the center channel.
 - Fixed an error caused by a post created with a non-string attachment field.
 - Fixed the opacity of the read state in the channel sidebar, as well as enhanced the opacity of the channel icon when the channel was unread.
 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to sign in with O365 authentication when the AuthData was formatted differently between Office365 OAuth and Office 365 OpenID.
 - Fixed an issue where custom emojis for custom statuses were not loaded on page refresh.
 - Fixed an issue where the “Set a status” placeholder in the profile popover was not correctly themed.
 - Fixed an issue where bots showed the integration owner's custom status in the post header in the right-hand side.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ComplianceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added a new config setting ``BatchSize``. Compliance Monitoring CSV files are no longer limited to 30,000 rows.

     - ``SupportEmail`` default value is now empty instead of ``_feedback@mattermost.com_``.
 - Under ``LogSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - A new setting ``EnableColor`` was added to ``LogSettings`` and ``NotificationLogSettings``. Non-JSON console logs will now be colored if that field is set to ``true``.
 - Under ``ServiceSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added ``EnableReliableWebSockets``, to make WebSocket messages more reliable by bufferring messages during a connection loss and then re-transmitting all unsent messages when the connection is revived.

### Upcoming Deprecations in Mattermost v6.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v6.0 release, which is scheduled for 2021/10/15. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. [Legacy Command Line Tools](/administration/command-line-tools.html). All commands have been fully replaced by [mmctl](/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html) and new commands have been added over the last few months, making this tool a full and robust replacement. 

2. [Slack Import via the web app](/administration/migrating.html?highlight=mmetl#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-web-app). The Slack import tool accessible via the Team Setting menu is being replaced by the [mmetl](/administration/migrating.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-mmetl-tool-and-bulk-import) tool that is much more comprehensive for the types of data it can assist in uploading. 

3. MySQL versions below 5.7.7. Minimum support will now be for 5.7.12. This version introduced a native JSON data type that lets us improve performance and scalability of several database fields (most notably Users and Posts props). Additionally, version 5.6 (our current minimum version) reached [EOL in February 2021](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

4. Elasticsearch 5 and 6 - [versions 5.x reached EOL in March of 2019, and versions 6.x reached EOL in November 2020](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). Our minimal supported version with Mattermost v6.0 will be Elasticsearch version 7.0.

5. Windows 7 reached [EOL in January 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962). We will no longer provide support for the Desktop App issues on Windows 7.

6. [DisableLegacyMFA](/configure/configuration-settings.html#disable-legacy-mfa-api-endpoint) configuration setting.

7. [ExperimentalTimezone](/configure/configuration-settings.html#timezone) configuration setting.

8. All legacy channel sidebar experimental configuration settings. We encourage customers using these settings to upgrade to v5.32 or later to access [custom, collapsible channel categories](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/) among many other channel organization features. The settings being deprecated include:

   - [EnableLegacySidebar](/administration/config-settings.html#enable-legacy-sidebar)
   - [ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly](/administration/config-settings.html#town-square-is-read-only-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS](/administration/config-settings.html#town-square-is-hidden-in-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS](/administration/config-settings.html#enable-x-to-leave-channels-from-left-hand-sidebar-experimental)
   - [CloseUnusedDirectMessages](/administration/config-settings.html#autoclose-direct-messages-in-sidebar-experimental)
   - [ExperimentalChannelOrganization](/administration/config-settings.html#sidebar-organization)
   - [ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization](/administration/config-settings.html#experimental-sidebar-features)

9. [All configuration settings previously marked as “Deprecated”](/administration/config-settings.html#deprecated-configuration-settings).

10. Changes to ``mattermost-server/model`` for naming consistency.

  - Original 5.35.0 release

Mattermost v5.35.0 contains low and medium level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

#### Important Upgrade Notes
   - Due to the introduction of backend database architecture required for upcoming new features, including Shared Channels and Collapsed Reply Threads, the performance of the migration process for the v5.35 release (May 16, 2021) has been noticeably affected. Depending on the size, type, and version of the database, longer than usual upgrade times should be expected. This can vary from a couple of minutes (average case) to hours (worst case, MySQL 5.x only). A moderate to significant spike in database CPU usage should also be expected during this process. [More details on the performance impact of the migration and possible mitigation strategies are provided here](https://gist.github.com/streamer45/9aee4906639a49ebde68b2f3c0f924c1).
   - v5.35.0 introduces a new feature to search for files. Search results for files shared in the past may be incomplete until a [content extraction command](/administration/command-line-tools.html#mattermost-extract-documents-content) is executed to extract and index the content of files already in the database. Instances running Elasticsearch or Bleve search backends will also need to execute a Bulk Indexing after the content extraction is complete. Please see more details in [this blog post](https://mattermost.com/blog/file-search/).
   - The existing password generation logic used during the bulk user import process was comparatively weak. Hence it's advised for admins to immediately reset the passwords for all the users who were generated during the bulk import process and whose password has not been changed even once.
   - In the v5.38 release (August 16, 2021), we will deprecate "config watcher" (the mechanism that automatically reloads the ``config.json file``), in favor of an mmctl command that will need to be run to apply configuration changes after they are made. This change will improve configuration performance and robustness.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.34, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Apps Framework (Developer Preview)
 - Apps Framework is a new way to integrate with external tools, and allows developers to create interactive apps in Mattermost, using any development language they're comfortable with. The new apps work seamlessly across mobile and desktop clients. This is a developer preview and is not intended for production instances of Mattermost yet. This feature is available for self-managed customers with v5.35 when the Apps Framework Plugin is loaded on an instance. Learn more: https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/.

#### Search for files and document contents
 - Searching in Mattermost now finds both relevant messages and files in your team’s conversation history. Search will return results for attachments that match the file name or contain matching text content within supported document types. [Learn more](https://mattermost.com/blog/file-search/).

#### Granular Access to System Console Pages (Enterprise E20 Edition)
 - Migrated **Experimental**, **About**, **Reporting**, **Environment**, **Site Configuration**, **Authentication**, **Integrations**, and **Compliance** sections to their respective sub-section permissions.

#### Shared Channels (Experimental, Enterprise Edition E20)
 - Experimental support added for sharing channels between Mattermost clusters. Requires an Enterprise Edition E20 license. The Shared Channels feature is disabled by default.

#### Enterprise Trial Enhancements (Enterprise E20 Edition)
 - Added banners to alert System Admins when an Enterprise Edition E20 trial has started, when there are three days left of the trial, and when the trial is on the last day.

#### Incident Collaboration (Enterprise Edition E20)
 - Updated prepackaged Incident Collaboration plugin with to include ad hoc tasks, stakeholder overview, and more.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added support to collapse in-line images over 100px in height.
 - Implemented maximum length validation on the status modal for custom statuses.
 - Synchronized collapsed channel sidebar categories on the server to keep category collapse states in-sync across devices.
 - Empty state is no longer off-centered in the **Channel Switcher**.
 - Ephemeral message created from call response ``markdown`` field is now posted by bot.
 - Added various enhancements to custom status to allow users to switch to recent statuses with less clicks.
 - Users can now see online status on user profile images in the channel switcher.
 - Added a string field to restricted domains configuration with the key ``RestrictLinkPreviews``, and added a UI field for restricted domains under **System Console > Site Configuration > Posts**. Also expanded the logic that determines whether a post has a preview or not.
 - Added an unread badge to the **Main Menu** icon and the **Plugin Marketplace** menu that displays until a System Admin visits the **Plugin Marketplace** for the first time.
 - Profile images are now visible on **Direct Messages** in the channel sidebar.
 - Added channel icons for email notifications as part of email notification redesigns.
 - Direct Messages **More...** modal is now sorted by recent conversations when the modal is opened.
 - Removed legacy Open-Sans fonts and upgraded Open-Sans to v18.

#### Administration
 - Paused Admin Advisor notifications from triggering.
 - Added a command line document extraction command that allows indexing documents by content.
 - Removed the utility function ``model.GeneratePassword()`` for security reasons. An improved version is now being used internally to generate passwords for bulk-imported users.
 - Only the System Admin is allowed to have the ability to assign system roles.
 - Two new gauge metrics were added: ``mattermost_db_replica_lag_abs`` and ``mattermost_db_replica_lag_time``, both containing a label of "node", signifying which database host is the metric from. 
     - These metrics signify the replica lag in absolute terms and in the time dimension capturing the whole picture of replica lag. To use these metrics, a separate config section ``ReplicaLagSettings`` was added under ``SqlSettings``. This is an array of maps which contain three keys: ``DataSource``, ``QueryAbsoluteLag``, and ``QueryTimeLag``. Each map entry is for a single replica instance. ``DataSource`` contains the database credentials to connect to the replica instance. ``QueryAbsoluteLag`` is a plain SQL query that must return a single row of which the first column must be the node value of the Prometheus metric, and the second column must be the value of the lag. ``QueryTimeLag`` is the same as above, but used to measure the time lag. 
     - As an example, for AWS Aurora instances, the ``QueryAbsoluteLag`` can be: ``select server_id highest_lsn_rcvd-durable_lsn as bindiff from aurora_global_db_instance_status()`` where ``server_id=<>`` and ``QueryTimeLag`` can be: ``select server_id, visibility_lag_in_msec aurora_global_db_instance_status()`` where ``server_id=<>``. For MySQL Group Replication, the absolute lag can be measured from the number of pending transactions in the applier queue: ``select member_id, count_transactions_remote_in_applier_queue FROM performance_schema.replication_group_member_stats`` where ``member_id=<>``. Overall, what query to choose is left to the administrator, and depending on the database and need, an appropriate query can be chosen.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed link previews on a number of websites, including Reddit.
 - Fixed an issue where SAML assigned Mattermost ``UserID`` as username if the value was invalid and did not log this.
 - Fixed an issue where hover effects for category sorting and **Direct Messages** category limit submenus were too dark on a dark theme.
 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to drag the vertical scroll bar on a PDF preview.
 - Fixed an issue with animations on long posts when highlighted as a permalink.
 - Fixed an issue where the user's nickname was not shown on channel switch.

 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to deactivate MFA for their accounts even if MFA was disabled on the server.
 - Fixed an issue where user settings on API could be set if LDAP Sync was on. For LDAP and SAML users, the following fields cannot be changed via the API if the corresponding LDAP/SAML attributes have been set: first name, last name, position, nickname, email, profile picture. For OAuth users (i.e., GitLab, Google, Office365, and OpenID), the following fields cannot be changed via the API: first name, last name. All users who authenticate via a method other than email cannot change their username via the API.
 - Fixed a possible panic on post creation when the collapsed threads feature was enabled.
 - Fixed a database deadlock that could happen if a sidebar category was updated and deleted at the same time.
 - Fixed an issue where the sidebar **Text Hover BG Theme** color didn’t work on the left-hand side.
 - Fixed an issue where the Team Admin’s current role was presented inconsistently in the different areas of the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Show more** background color on long posts was broken for permalinks.
 - Fixed an issue where redirecting with JS failed when Content Security Policy was enabled and restricted with ``unsafe-inline``.

## Release v5.33 - [Feature Release](/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v5.33.5, released 2021-06-11**
  - Mattermost v5.33.5 contains a high level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).
- **v5.33.4, released 2021-06-03**
  - Fixed an issue where subsequent migrations failed to run after running a dot release on new installations. [MM-35931](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-35931)
  - Added a performance improvement to the emoji picker overlay to improve typing performance.
- **v5.33.3, released 2021-03-31**
  - Fixed an issue where, after migrating to OpenID, Office 365 returned different ID attributes based on user type, causing an error for users with expired sessions when they tried to sign in to Mattermost. [MM-34356](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34356)
- **v5.33.2, released 2021-03-25**
  - Improved typing performance on busy servers with lots of active users and with the new sidebar enabled. [MM-30407](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-30407)
  - Reverted the WebSocket improvement added in v5.33.0 where epoll was used to manually read from a WebSocket connection. It was reverted because unofficial Mattermost builds in several different platforms broke due to the WebSocket changes. [MM-34158](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34158)
- **v5.33.1, released 2021-03-22**
  - Fixed an issue where WebSockets failed with TLS connections. [MM-34000](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34000)
  - Fixed a race condition which would crash the app server due to improper handling of WebSocket closing. [MM-33233](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33233)
  - Fixed an issue where the ``mmctl config`` command  didn't recognize newer settings (e.g. ``ClusterSettings.EnableGossipCompression``)  that were introduced in v5.33.0. [MM-34046](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34046)
- **v5.33.0, released 2021-03-17**
  - Original 5.33.0 release

Mattermost v5.33.0 contains low-level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) to this release is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Important Upgrade Notes
 - Deleting a reaction is now a soft delete in the ``Reactions`` table. A schema update is required and may take up to 15 seconds on first run with large data sets.
 - WebSocket handshakes done with an HTTP version lower than 1.1 will result in a warning, and the server will transparently upgrade the version to 1.1 to comply with the WebSocket RFC. This is done to work around incorrect Nginx (and other proxy) configs that do not set the ``proxy_http_version`` directive to 1.1. This facility will be removed in a future Mattermost version. It is strongly recommended to fix the proxy configuration to correctly use the WebSocket protocol.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.32, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### OpenID Connect for OAuth 2.0 Authentication (E20 Edition)
 - OpenID Connect enables authentication to Mattermost using any OAuth 2.0 provider that adheres to the OpenID Connect specification. This feature is available for Mobile Apps in the v1.40 release.

#### Support Packet Generation (E10 & E20 Editions)
 - Mattermost provides the ability to download configuration details, logs, and other deployment information when requesting commercial support for Mattermost self-managed E10 or E20 Enterprise editions, or Mattermost Cloud editions.

#### Updated Incident Collaboration Plugin to 1.4.0 (E20 Edition)
 - Added an Incident Timeline to support status updates and other key events shown chronologically in the right-hand sidebar. The timeline enables users to easily gather information for post-incident reports.
 
#### Custom Statuses
 - Users now gain the flexibility to express their current status in any way they prefer. Set a custom status to add a descriptive status message and emoji that’s visible to everyone throughout the app.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Improved the **Add Members** to channel modal.
 - Added **Formatting** shortcut keys to the **Shortcut** modal.
 - Added localization to the date picker used when searching for posts around a given date.
 - The autocomplete popover is now positioned relative to the @, ~, or / trigger in the post draft.
 - Removed the 5-page limit on previewing PDFs.
 - Added ``files`` as a reserved team name.
 - Searching for a channel by URL now returns the channel.
 - Users are now provided with feedback when creating a custom category name that exceeds the character limit.

#### Notifications
 - Posts from OAuth 2.0 bots no longer trigger mentions for the user.

#### Administration
 - Added an ``ImportDelete`` job to periodically delete unused import files after a configurable retention period has passed.
 - Introduced new ``mattermost_system_server_start_time`` and ``mattermost_jobs_active`` metrics for improved debugging with Grafana dashboards.
 - Deleting a reaction is now a soft delete in the ``Reactions`` table. A schema update is required and may take up to 15 seconds on first run with large data sets.
 - Changed default ``MaxFileSize`` from 50MB to 100MB.
 - Updated Go dependencies to their latest minor version.
 - Added support for compressed export files with attachments.
 - Server crashes due to runtime panics are now captured as a log line.
 - Optimized **Direct Message** creation by fetching all users involved in a single database call.
 - During the user import process, a change in a user's ``NotifyProps`` will not send an email notification. This is done to make it consistent with other parts of the import process where a change in user's attributes would also not send any notifications.
 - Implemented a job to delete unused export files.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the Database Schema upgrade step for v5.29.1 was not taken into account in releases v5.30 and later.
 - Fixed an issue where ``mmctl channel move`` did not allow moving private channels.
 - Fixed an issue where ``mmctl config set PluginSettings.EnableUploads`` to change a configuration value did not return an error.
 - Fixed an issue where the instructions to search for users in **System Console > Reporting > Server Logs** were not up-to-date.
 - Fixed an issue where no error message was displayed when adding an LDAP Group Synchronized Team in **System Console > User Management > Users**.
 - Fixed an issue where markdown tables did not wrap correctly.
 - Fixed an issue where the search bar styling on dark themes was incorrect on mobile web view.
 - Fixed an issue where the **Main Menu** on webapp appeared more left-aligned than previous releases.
 - Fixed an issue where sticky sidebar headings appeared under **More Unreads**.
 - Fixed an issue where the group channel icon was misaligned in the channel switcher.
 - Fixed an issue where line breaks were ignored when used with inline images.
 - Fixed an issue where the channel switcher did not focus on the first list result after a backspace.
 - Fixed an issue where demoting a user to a guest would not take effect in an environment with read replicas.
 - Fixed a bug with in-product notices where a date constraint might fail to match, which would lead to the notice not being fetched.
 - Fixed an issue where creation of a bot would fail due to replica lag.
 - The ``DownloadComplianceReport`` function in the Golang driver has been fixed to download a full report as a zip archive.
 - Fixed Cache-Control headers to instruct that responses may only be cached on browsers.
 - Fixed a panic when the OAuth discovery endpoint would not return a Cache-Control header.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``ClusterSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added ``EnableGossipCompression``, to disable compression in the Gossip protocol. By default the value of the setting is ``true``. This is done to maintain compatibility with old servers in a cluster. Once all servers in a cluster are upgraded, it is recommended to disable this setting for better performance.
 - Under ``SqlSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added ``ConnMaxIdleTimeMilliseconds``, to allow System Admins to control the maximum time a database connection can remain idle. The default value is set to 5 minutes.
 - Under ``TeamSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added ``EnableCustomUserStatuses``, to allow users to set descriptive status messages and optional status emoji that are visible to all users.
    
### Go Version
 - v5.33 is built with Go ``1.15.5``.

### Open Source Components
 - Added ``types/react-overlays``, ``crypto-browserify``, ``process`` and ``stream-browserify``, and removed ``node-semver`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp.
 - Removed ``isomorphic-fetch`` from https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux.

### API Changes
 - Added a new ``GET /{team_id}/threads/{thread_id}`` API method for retrieving single threads.
 - Added a new ``/exports`` API endpoint to generate and manage export files.
 - Added a new ``/users/{user_id}/teams/{team_id}/threads/mention_counts`` API endpoint.
 - Added a new ``GET /api/v4/cloud/subscription/stats`` API endpoint.
 - Added a new ``GET /api/v4/cloud/subscription/limitreached/invite`` API endpoint.
 - Added new ``PUT /api/v4/users/<id>/status/custom``, ``DELETE /api/v4/users/<id>/status/custom``, and ``DELETE /api/v4/users/<id>/status/custom/recent`` API endpoints.
 - The ``/api/v4/users/me/auth`` API endpoint can no longer be used to change passwords. This was a hidden feature that was not documented, but was nevertheless possible. We have removed this hidden feature.
 - Updated ``/users/{user_id}/teams/{team_id}/threads`` API to support the ``unread=true`` query parameter.
 - The ``/api/v4/users/{user_id}/teams/{team_id}/threads`` API endpoint now accepts "before" and "after" parameters instead of a page index.
 - Removed the session required restriction from the ``GET api/v4/subscription/stats`` API endpoint.

### Websocket Event Changes
 - Improved the WebSocket implementation by using epoll to manually read from a WebSocket connection. As a result, the number of goroutines is expected to go down by half. This implementation is only available on Linux and FreeBSD-based distributions.
 - The ``UserUpdate`` WebSocket Event is now broadcast by two more APIs, ``plugin.UpdateUser`` and ``ConvertBotToUser``.

### Known Issues
 - Config.json can reset when running the command ``systemctl restart mattermost``, and when running any commands that write to the config (e.g. ``config`` or ``plugin``) [MM-33752](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33752), [MM-32390](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-32390).
 - The server tries to install E20-required plugins on non-E20 installations [MM-32387](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-32387).
 - Adding an at-mention at the start of a post draft, then pressing the left or right arrow can clear the post draft and the undo history [MM-33823](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33823).
 - In some cases, the **New messages** toast appears without replacing variables with text. [MM-33829](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33829)
 - Posts created by bots containing attachments sometimes appear as repeated until the user refreshes the page [MM-30980](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-30980).
 - Emoji counter in the center channel doesn't always update immediately when a reaction is added in the right-hand side [MM-31994](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-31994).

## Release v5.32 - [Feature Release](/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v5.32.1, released 2021-02-17**
  - Fixed an issue where any search containing an underscore failed on PostgreSQL databases. This was fixed by reverting a v5.32.0 feature that added support for searching for terms on PostgreSQL that contain underscores.
- **v5.32.0, released 2021-02-16**
  - Original 5.32.0 release

Mattermost v5.32.0 contains low level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Compatibility
 - TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 have been deprecated by browser vendors. Starting in Mattermost Server v5.32 (February 16), mmctl returns an error when connected to Mattermost servers deployed with these TLS versions and System Admins will need to explicitly add a flag in their commands to continue to use them. We recommend upgrading to TLS version 1.2 or higher.
 - PostgreSQL ended long-term support for [version 9.4 in February 2020](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning). From v5.26 Mattermost officially supports PostgreSQL version 10 as PostgreSQL 9.4 is no longer supported. New installs will require PostgreSQL 10+. Previous Mattermost versions will continue to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4. PostgreSQL 9.4 and all 9.x versions are now fully deprecated in our v5.30 release (December 16, 2020). Please follow the instructions under the Upgrading Section within [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/). Mattermost will now fail to start if the Postgres version is below that.

### Breaking Changes
 - ``ExperimentalChannelOrganization``, ``EnableXToLeaveChannelsFromLHS``, ``CloseUnusedDirectMessages``, and ``ExperimentalHideTownSquareinLHS`` settings are only functional if the Legacy Sidebar (``EnableLegacySidebar``) is enabled since they are not compatible with the new sidebar experience. ``ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization`` has been deprecated, since the [new sidebar is now enabled for all users](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/). 
 - Breaking changes to the Golang client API were introduced: ``GetPostThread``, ``GetPostsForChannel``, ``GetPostsSince``, ``GetPostsAfter``, ``GetPostsBefore``, and ``GetPostsAroundLastUnread`` now require an additional collapsedThreads parameter to be passed. Any client making use of these functions will need to update them when upgrading its dependencies.
 - [A breaking change was introduced when upgrading the Go version to v1.15.5](https://golang.org/doc/go1.15#commonname) where user logins fail with AD/LDAP Sync when the certificate of the LDAP Server has no Subject Alternative Name (SAN) in it. Creating a new certificate on the AD/LDAP Server with the SAN inside fixes this.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.31, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### General availability of custom, collapsible channel categories
 - Mattermost now gives users flexibility to organize channels and direct messages into custom, collapsible sidebar categories. Users gain full personalization of their sidebar to improve productivity, reduce clutter and focus on what matters. Learn more about [the new channel sidebar enhancements](https://mattermost.com/blog/custom-collapsible-channel-categories/).

#### Self-serve renewals (E10 & E20 Editions)
 - Mattermost is introducing the ability to renew your self-managed E10 or E20 license subscription online with a credit card. This feature creates a frictionless experience for System Administrators to renew their license without the need to contact sales. The renewal process takes place in [the customer portal](https://customers.mattermost.com/signup) and only takes a few minutes to complete.
 
#### Incident Collaboration v1.3.2 (E20 Edition)
 - Pre-packaged Incident Collaboration v1.3.2 offers a more specific incident status and centralized task list.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added new languages, Bulgarian and Swedish.
 - Added team sidebar user interface and animation enhancements.
 - Moved the header icons to the left of the header beside the channel description.
 - Added support to move multi-selected groups of channels to another category via the **More options** menu.

#### Plugins
 - Updated bundled plugin packages, including GitHub and Jenkins plugins.
 - Enabled experimental support for ARM64 plugins by allowing any matching ``GOOS-GOOARCH`` combination in the plugin manifest.

#### Administration
 - ``AnalyticsPostCount`` now avoids unnecessary table scans during various background jobs.
 - The Help text for the Rate Limiting setting was updated to explain the purpose of rate limiting.
 - Removed the word "experimental" from the Gossip setting in the System Console.
 - Updated the Go version to v1.15.5.
 - Added support for automatic installation and enablement of plugins using feature flags.
 - Added ``webhook create`` endpoints to local mode and the ability to create webhooks for other users.
 - Added a Mattermost CLI command to initialize the database.
 - Added support for processing import files through the API.
 - Added support for protocol-relative URLs while using the Image Proxy.
 - A Striped LRU cache is now used by default.
 - Added shared channels and ``remote_cluster_service`` under a license check.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the Admin Filter option was not disabled in the AD/LDAP page for Admin roles with a ``sysconsole_write_authentication`` permission.
 - Fixed an issue where channels would sometimes be removed from custom categories when a user left a team.
 - Fixed an issue where the error text was missing when the team name was left blank on the Team Create page.
 - Fixed an issue where the System Manager was able to download the Compliance Export files.
 - Fixed an issue where themed button colours in interactive message attachments in Mattermost’s default dark theme were mismatched.
 - Fixed an issue where bold and italics shortcuts triggered with CTRL+B on Mac.
 - Fixed an issue where a "Your license does not support cloud requests” log error appeared on self-hosted servers.
 - Fixed an issue where the permissions of a System Admin role got deleted when changing the access level to any permission.
 - Fixed an issue where editing a ``/me`` post behaved differently within the Mattermost Web App and the Mobile App.
 - Fixed an issue where the hover state on category headers did not span the whole width of the left-hand navigation.
 - Fixed an issue where plugins on the left-hand side of the System Console were sorted differently than the ones in the Plugin Management page.
 - Fixed an issue where 15-character team names were truncated when the experimental channel sidebar was enabled.
 - Fixed an issue where the sidebar menus weren't styled correctly in mobile browser view.
 - Fixed an issue where jumping into an archive channel and clicking the link to jump to recent messages sent the user out of the archived channel.
 - Fixed an issue where the tooltip text for copying an incoming webhook URL was unclear.

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to ``config.json``. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in ``config.json``, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Deprecated the ``ExperimentalChannelSidebarOrganization`` setting and added a new ``EnableLegacySidebar`` setting. The new channel sidebar will be enabled system-wide by default.
 - The ``UseExperimentalGossip`` field under ClusterSettings is now ``true`` by default. This means that new installations will use the Gossip protocol for cluster communication. There will be no changes to existing installations. The Gossip protocol is now considered to be in General Availability and is the recommended clustering mode.
 - Enabled ``ExperimentalDataPrefetch`` for all servers and removed the corresponding setting.
 - Under ``NativeAppSettings`` in ``config.json``:
     - Added a ``AppCustomURLSchemes`` setting to add the ability to redirect to the mobile app after OAuth & SAML auth completion.
    
### Go Version

## Release v5.28 - [Feature Release](/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

- **v5.28.2, released 2020-12-03**
  - Disabled the xmlsec1-based SAML library in favor of the re-enabled and improved SAML library.
- **v5.28.1, released 2020-10-19**
  - Fixed an issue where mmctl Command Line Tool (Beta) was broken on Mattermost server v5.28.0. [MM-29740](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-29740)
  - Fixed an issue where the Compliance Exports were taking too long on large deployments. This was fixed with a performance optimization of the message export query.
- **v5.28.0, released 2020-10-16**
  - Original 5.28.0 release

### Compatibility
 - PostgreSQL ended long-term support for [version 9.4 in February 2020](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning). Mattermost is officially supporting PostgreSQL version 10 with v5.26 release as PostgreSQL 9.4 is no longer supported. New installs will require PostgreSQL 10+. Previous Mattermost versions, including our current ESR, will continue to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4. We plan on fully deprecating PostgreSQL 9.4 and all 9.x versions in our v5.30 release (December 16, 2020). Please follow the instructions under the Upgrading Section within [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).
 - Support for Mattermost Server [Extended Support Release](/administration/extended-support-release.html) (ESR) 5.19 has come to the end of its lifecycle. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v5.25 or later is required.
 - TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 have been deprecated by browser vendors. Starting in v5.31 (January 16, 2021) mmctl will return an error when connected to Mattermost servers deployed with these TLS versions and System Admins will need to explicitly add a flag in their commands to continue to use them. We recommend upgrading to TLS version 1.2 or higher.

### Breaking Changes
 - Now when the service crashes, it will generate a coredump instead of just dumping the stack trace to the console. This allows us to preserve the full information of the crash to help with debugging it. For more information about coredumps, please see: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html.  

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than v5.27, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### New admin roles to delegate administration tasks to other types of administrators (E20)
 - New admin roles are additional system roles that have access to designated areas of the System Console. This enables you to delegate certain administrative tasks to other members of your organization.

#### Certificate-based authentication with AD/LDAP (E10)
 - You can now improve the security of your AD/LDAP authentication with certificate-based AD/LDAP authentication.

#### Stay current with in-product notices
 - With in-product notices, users and Admins will be made aware of the newest product enhancements from within Mattermost. [Learn more about in-product notices here](/administration/notices.html).

## Release v5.26 - [Feature Release](/administration/release-definitions.html#feature-release)

- **v5.26.2, released 2020-09-03**
  - Forcefully disabled the SAML Setting "Use Improved SAML Library (Beta)", as we have identified some issues in this feature. Please follow instructions at https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-saml-before-you-begin.html for enabling SAML using the feature-equivalent ``xmlsec1`` utility.
- **v5.26.1, released 2020-08-25**
  - Fixed an issue where users were unable to use the [``PictureAttribute`` setting](/administration/config-settings.html#profile-picture-attribute) with SAML authentication. [MM-27852](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27852)
  - Fixed an issue where users got unexpectedly logged out from the mobile app when ``ExtendSessionLengthWithActivity`` was enabled as opening the mobile app called an API that overrode session extension triggers of typing, channel change, and posts. [MM-27184](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27184)
  - Fixed an issue where users experienced a kernel panic during LDAP sync when AuthData value was null. [MM-27965](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27965)
- **v5.26.0, released 2020-08-16**
  - Original 5.26.0 release

### Compatibility
 - PostgreSQL ended long-term support for [version 9.4 in February 2020](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning). Mattermost is officially supporting PostgreSQL version 10 with v5.26 release as PostgreSQL 9.4 is no longer supported. New installs will require PostgreSQL 10+. Previous Mattermost versions, including our current ESR, will continue to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4. In our 6.0 release (date to be announced), we plan on fully deprecating PostgreSQL 9.4. Please follow the instructions under the Upgrading Section within [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

### Breaking Changes
 - In v5.26, Elasticsearch indexes needed to be recreated. Admins should re-index Elasticsearch using the **Purge index** and then **Index now** button so that all the changes will be included in the index. Systems may be left with a limited search during the indexing, so it should be done during a time when there is little to no activity because it may take several hours.
 - An ``EnableExperimentalGossipEncryption`` option was added under ``ClusterSettings``. If this is set to ``true``, and ``UseExperimentalGossip`` is also ``true``, all communication through the cluster using the gossip protocol will be encrypted. The encryption uses ``AES-256`` by default, and it is not kept configurable by design. However, if one wishes, they can set the value in Systems table manually for the ``ClusterEncryptionKey`` row. A key is a byte array converted to base64. It should be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256. To update the key, one can execute ``UPDATE Systems SET Value='<value>' WHERE Name='ClusterEncryptionKey';`` in MySQL and ``UPDATE systems SET value='<value>' WHERE name='ClusterEncryptionKey'`` for PostgreSQL. For any change in this config setting to take effect, the whole cluster must be shutdown first. Then the config change made, and then restarted. In a cluster, all servers either will completely use encryption or not. There cannot be any partial usage.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.25, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

- **v5.25.7, released 2020-12-03**
  - Disabled the xmlsec1-based SAML library in favor of the re-enabled and improved SAML library.
- **v5.25.6, released 2020-11-10**
  - Fixed an issue where the Compliance Exports were taking too long on large deployments. This was fixed with a performance optimization of the message export query.
  - Bumped up Go patch version to 1.14.6 to fix an issue where a potential livelock was detected in the app server under heavy load. [MM-26584](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26584)
- **v5.25.5, released 2020-09-03**

- **v5.25.4, released 2020-08-25**
  - Fixed an issue where users were unable to use the [``PictureAttribute`` setting](/administration/config-settings.html#profile-picture-attribute) with SAML authentication. [MM-27852](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27852)
  - Fixed an issue where users got unexpectedly logged out from the mobile app when ``ExtendSessionLengthWithActivity`` was enabled as opening the mobile app called an API that overrode session extension triggers of typing, channel change, and posts. [MM-27184](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27184)
  - Fixed an issue where users experienced a kernel panic during LDAP sync when AuthData value was null. [MM-27965](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27965)
  - Fixed an issue where users experienced the Mattermost server crashing on ``(Status).ToClusterJson`` calls. [MM-24544](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-24544)

  - Fixed an issue where deactivated users were included in compliance exports. [MM-27194](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27194)
  - Fixed an issue where guest user invites did not work in a SAML environment. [MM-27519](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27519)
  - Fixed an issue where the bulk export didn't finish if a custom data directory was set. [MM-27550](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27550)
  - Fixed an issue with a performance degradation after upgrading to 5.25.0. [MM-27575](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27575)
  - Fixed an issue where attempting to pin a post failed if a user did not have the ``channel_mention`` permission on a channel. [MM-26346](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26346)
- **v5.25.2, released 2020-07-31**
  - Fixed an issue where pages in the System Console didn't scroll up or down in some browser versions. [MM-27168](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27168)
- **v5.25.1, released 2020-07-23**
  - Smoothed the database query load while syncing teams and channel roles by fetching data in batches. [MM-27114](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27114)
  - Fixed a bug in pagination which queried more data redundantly. [MM-27187](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27187)

- **v5.25.0, released 2020-07-16**

### config.json
Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:
 - Under ``SamlSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``ServiceProviderIdentifier``, as the unique identifier for the Service Provider, usually the same as Service Provider Login Url. In ADFS, this must match the Relying Party Identifier.

## Release v5.24 - [Feature Release](/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

- **v5.24.3, released 2020-07-23**
  - Smoothed the database query load while syncing teams and channel roles by fetching data in batches. [MM-27114](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27114)
  - Fixed a bug in pagination which queried more data redundantly. [MM-27187](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27187)
  - Throttled network traffic by implementing bounded concurrency.
- **v5.24.2, released 2020-06-26**
  - Fixed an issue where changing primary keys during migration did not work with Postgres versions lower than 9.3. [MM-26514](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26514)
- **v5.24.1, released 2020-06-19**
  - Fixed an issue with a semantic versioning violation of the plugin API that broke plugins using the ``GetGroupByName`` method. [MM-26231](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26231)
  - Fixed an issue with the Plugin Tooltip implementation that caused links to be truncated when rendered. This issue occured if you are using the recent GitHub plugin v1.0.0 release. All links were affected, regardless if they were related to GitHub. [MM-25808](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-25808)
- **v5.24.0, released 2020-06-16**
  - Original 5.24.0 release

Mattermost v5.24.0 contains low level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Breaking Changes
 - A new configuration setting, ``ExtendSessionLengthWithActivity`` automatically extends sessions to keep users logged in if they are active in their Mattermost apps. It is recommended to enable this setting to improve user experience if compliant with your organizations policies. [Learn more here](https://mattermost.com/blog/session-expiry-experience).
 - The ``mattermost_http_request_duration_seconds`` histogram metric (in Enterprise Edition) has been removed. This information was already captured by ``mattermost_api_time``, which also contains the api handler name, HTTP method, and the response code. As an example, if you are using ``rate(mattermost_http_request_duration_seconds_sum{server=~"$var"}[5m]) /   rate(mattermost_http_request_duration_seconds_count{server=~"$var"}[5m])`` to measure average call duration, it needs to be replaced with ``sum(rate(mattermost_api_time_sum{server=~"$var"}[5m])) by (instance) /   sum(rate(mattermost_api_time_count{server=~"$var"}[5m])) by (instance)``.
 - Due to fixing performance issues related to emoji reactions, the performance of the upgrade has been affected in that the schema upgrade now takes more time in environments with lots of reactions in their database. These environments are recommended to perform the schema migration during low usage times and potentially in advance of the upgrade. Since this migration happens before the Mattermost Server is fully launched, non-High Availability installs will be unreachable during this time. Please see the [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for full details.
 - On mobile apps, users will not be able to see LDAP group mentions (E20 feature) in the autocomplete dropdown. Users will still receive notifications if they are part of an LDAP group. However, the group mention keyword will not be highlighted.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.23, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Notify AD/LDAP Groups with a single @mention (Beta) (E20) 
 - Ability to enable mentions for LDAP-synced groups so users can notify the entire group at the same time.

#### Manage users from the System Console (E20)
 - Ability to view and manage members via each team or channel configuration page.

#### Sync profile images from AD/LDAP (E10, E20) 
 - Ability to ensure compliance with corporate policies by automatically syncing profile images from AD/LDAP.

#### Automatically extending user sessions
 - Ability to enable a feature that automatically extends session lengths when users are active on Mattermost apps.

#### Access CLI remotely
 - Ability to manage Mattermost without having direct access to the server with a new Local Mode for mmctl.

#### Improved search filters
 - Ability to use the mouse or keyboard to select search filters instead of typing them manually.
 
#### Slash command autocomplete framework (Beta)
 - Ability to make slash commands easier to use and increase discoverability with a new slash command autocomplete framework for plugins.

#### Full-text search and indexing (Experimental)
 - Ability to use Bleve to execute search functionality instead of the database.

### Improvements

#### Enterprise Edition (EE)
 - Grace period after Enterprise Edition subscription expires was reduced from 15 days to 10 days. Moreover, Enterprise features are now disabled immediately after the grace period is over, instead of only after a server restart. Please see https://mattermost.com/pricing/#faq for more details.

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added a count for pinned posts header icon.
 - Added the ability to view user profile pop-over when clicking the profile picture or username from the **View Members** and **Manage Members** modals.

#### Notifications
 - Mention notification settings for "Case sensitive first name" and "Non-case sensitive username" are now disabled by default.
 
#### Search
 - Added support for searching by position in user lists such as the **Add Members** menu.
 
#### Integrations
 - Added support for different interactive message button styles.

#### Administration
 - Added the ability to bulk create, update, and delete team members and channel members in the store, as well as bulk import users belonging to different teams and channels.
 - Added auditing support to all Comman Line Interface (CLI) API’s.
 - Replaced "Back to Mattermost" button with a helpful error message in the OAuth 2.0 authentication window when an incorrect Client ID is typed during authentication.
 - Centralized ID validation to a single function.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue where Session Idle Timeout setting also unexpectedly affected the mobile app session expiry.
 - Fixed an issue where an unread channel disappeared from a list of unread channels immediately.
 - Fixed an issue where a user's role was not reflected correctly in the **Team Members** modal when the user's role was updated after the modal was opened.
 - Fixed an issue where the autocomplete list of channels remained populated after a user cleared the search on **Add user to a channel** modal.
 - Fixed an issue where Integrations menu was available for member and team admin roles only if with oAuth2 permission.
 - Fixed an issue where empty strings for ``auth_data`` created invalid users for LDAP sync during bulk import.
 - Fixed an issue where bulk import did not report errors when importing posts failed.
 - Fixed an issue where Compliance Export reported "success" when failing to export a missing file.

## Release v5.23 - [Quality Release](/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

- **v5.23.2, released 2020-07-23**
  - Smoothed the database query load while syncing teams and channel roles by fetching data in batches. [MM-27114](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27114)
  - Fixed a bug in pagination which queried more data redundantly. [MM-27187](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27187)
  - Throttled network traffic by implementing bounded concurrency.
- **v5.23.1, released 2020-06-02**
  - Fixed an issue where ``Content-Type`` was no longer optional in incoming webhook requests and led to errors. [MM-25677](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-25677)
- **v5.23.0, released 2020-05-16**
  - Original 5.23.0 release

Mattermost v5.23.0 contains a low level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Compatibility
PostgreSQL ended long-term support for [version 9.4 in February 2020](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning). Mattermost will officially be supporting PostgreSQL version 10 with the Mattermost v5.26 release as PostgreSQL 9.4 is no longer supported. New installs will require PostgreSQL version 10. Previous Mattermost versions, including our current ESR, will continue to be compatible with PostgreSQL version 9.4. In our 6.0 release (date to be announced), we plan on fully deprecating PostgreSQL 9.4. 

We highly recommend upgrading to PostgreSQL version 10+. Please follow the instructions under the Upgrading Section within [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

## Release v5.22 - [Feature Release](/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

- **v5.22.3, released 2020-05-11**
  - Fixed an issue where channels were shown as read-only when [Channel Moderation feature](/deployment/advanced-permissions.html#channel-moderation-beta-e20) was used in High Availability environments. [MM-24987](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-24987)
- **v5.22.2, released 2020-05-05**
  - Fixed an issue where message reply threads did not get correctly imported via [bulk loading tool](/deployment/bulk-loading.html). [MM-24707](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-24707)
- **v5.22.1, released 2020-04-23**
  - Fixed an issue where Amazon S3 file storage with IAM credentials failed due to a bug in the ``minio-go`` library. [MM-24388](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-24388)
- **v5.22.0, released 2020-04-16**
  - Original 5.22.0 release

**Release day: 2020-04-16**

Mattermost v5.22.0 contains a low level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Compatibility

 - v5.9.0 as our Extended Support Release (ESR) is coming to the end of its lifecycle and upgrading to 5.19.0 ESR or a later version is highly recommended. v5.19.0 will continue to be our current ESR until October 15, 2020. [Learn more in our forum post](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/upcoming-extended-support-release-updates/8526).

### Breaking Changes

 - Due to fixing performance issues related to emoji reactions, the performance of the upgrade has been affected in that the schema upgrade now takes more time in environments with lots of reactions in their database. These environments are recommended to perform the schema migration during low usage times and potentially in advance of the upgrade. Since this migration happens before the Mattermost Server is fully launched, non-High Availability installs will be unreachable during this time.
 - The Channel Moderation Settings feature is supported on mobile app versions v1.30 and later. In earlier versions of the mobile app, users who attempt to post or react to posts without proper permissions will see an error.
 - Direct access to the ``Props`` field in the ``model.Post`` structure has been deprecated. The available ``GetProps()`` and ``SetProps()`` methods should now be used. Also, direct copy of the ``model.Post`` structure must be avoided in favor of the provided ``Clone()`` method.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.21, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Read-only channels and channel moderation settings (E20) (Beta)
 - System admins can use new channel-specific permissions to create read-only channels, restrict who can post in certain channels, and more. This feature is in beta and ships with Enterprise Edition E20.

#### Team switch shortcuts
 - Added new keyboard shortcuts that allow users to switch to the next or previous team using ``Ctrl/⌘ + Alt + Up/Down`` and switch to a specific team using ``Ctrl/⌘ + Alt + #``.
 - Also added the ability to reorder teams on the sidebar via drag-and-drop.

#### Unarchive Channel option in the archived channels menu
 - Added the ability for users to restore archived channels via the Mattermost interface.
 
#### Channel sidebar reorganization features (Experimental)
 - Added improvements to the channel sidebar, including the ability to collapse categories in the sidebar (e.g., favorites, public channels, private channels, and direct messages) to reduce unnecessary scrolling.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added several UI improvements, such as added a "Close Group Message" option to Group Message menu.
 - Added a keyboard shortcut to open/close the right-hand sidebar.
 - Added a keyboard shortcut to add reactions to last message in a channel or a thread.

## Release v5.20 - [Feature Release](/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

- **v5.20.2, released 2020-03-12**
  - Fixed an issue where Mattermost server crashed when running a compliance export. [MM-23157](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23157)
  - Fixed an issue where switching to an unread channel got stuck at "Loading..." in certain screen resolutions. [MM-22698](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22698)
- **v5.20.1, released 2020-02-16**
  - Fixed an issue where upgrading to v5.20 failed on servers running with ``PluginSettings.Enable = false``, and ``LogSettings.EnableDiagnostics = true``.
- **v5.20.0, released 2020-02-16**
  - Original 5.20.0 release

Mattermost v5.20.0 contains a low level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
 - Any [pre-packaged plugin](/administration/plugins.html#pre-packaged-plugins) that is not enabled in the ``config.json`` will no longer install automatically, but can continue to be installed via the [plugin marketplace](/administration/plugins.html#plugin-marketplace).
 - Boolean elements from interactive dialogs are no longer serialized as strings. While we try to avoid breaking changes, this change was necessary to allow both the web and mobile apps to work with the boolean elements introduced with v5.16.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.19, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### A Banner to Jump to the Most Recent Posts
 - Ability to jump to the most recent posts in a channel by clicking a banner that automatically appears in busy channels with unread messages.
 
#### Open Email Notifications in the Desktop or Mobile App
 - Ability to open messages from email notifications in the Mattermost desktop or mobile apps instead of being directed to open them in the browser.
 
#### Ship MMCTL with Mattermost
 - Manage servers remotely with `mmctl`, a CLI tool that mimics the Mattermost CLI tool and ships inside Mattermost.

#### Reworked pre-packaged plugins
 - Pre-packaged plugins are now “pre-downloaded” plugins that are available within the Plugin Marketplace, even if your server doesn’t have direct access to the internet.
 
#### Plugin Marketplace Labels
 - Plugins supported by Mattermost and community supported plugins will be visible, making it easier to select an appropriate plugin based on your organization’s security policies.
  
#### Role mapping from LDAP and SAML (E20)
 - Ability to assign and restrict users to roles within Mattermost from your single sign-on (SSO) system.
 
#### Faster SAML install and configuration (E20)
 - Ability to use SAML without installing a separate binary and pull configuration metadata directly from the Identity Provider using an account-specific URL.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added support for mute option in Direct Message channel menus.
 - Added a red dot to browser favicon when there are unread mentions.
 - Added support for displaying a left-hand side bot icon in the webapp.

 - Allowed user autocomplete to match on terms with spaces.
 - Improved autocomplete highlighting when using mouse and keyboard together.
 - Added support for showing single image thumbnails in compact view.
 - Contents of View Members and Manage Members modals now refresh when a user's role has changed.
 - Filtering search by channel now also shows the channel name and not only its ID.
 - Users now cannot type account input fields longer than the maximum length for first name, last name and email fields.
 
#### Plugins
 - Added a way to show that a plugin requires a certain Mattermost configuration setting.
 - Added support for plugins to add menu items to the Channel Menu.
 
#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Added a CLI command ``webhook move`` for moving outgoing webhooks.
 
#### Bulk Import
 - When bulk import finds an already existing post, it now deletes existing files before importing new ones.
 - Bulk export now includes direct messages from a user to themselves.

#### Administration
 - Added support for Elasticsearch 7.
 - Added ability to inform System Admins when a user who managed bot accounts is deactivated, and enable them to take ownership of the bot.
 - Added LDAP/Elasticsearch/SQL Trace to server logs to make it easier for admins to diagnose problems.
 - Added ``plugins`` to the list of words that a team URL cannot start with.
 - Removed 26 character requirement from post action IDs.

## Release v5.19 - [ESR](/administration/extended-support-release.html)

Mattermost v5.19.0 contains low to high level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

- **v5.19.3, released 2020-06-19**
  - Fixed an issue with the Plugin Tooltip implementation that caused links to be truncated when rendered. This issue occured if you are using the recent GitHub plugin v1.0.0 release. All links were affected, regardless if they were related to GitHub. [MM-25808]
- **v5.19.2, released 2020-04-21**
  - Fixed an issue with unexpected crashes related to any action taken to modify post properties such as push notifications. Note for developers: Direct access to the ``Props`` field in the ``model.Post`` structure has been deprecated. To avoid crash issues, the available ``GetProps()`` and ``SetProps()`` methods should now be used. Also, direct copy of the ``model.Post`` structure must be avoided in favor of the provided ``Clone()`` method. [MM-21378](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21378)
  - Fixed an issue where a public channel appears in the list of Direct Message channels in the channel sidebar if the channel name is 40 characters long. [MM-23427](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23427)
- **v5.19.1, released 2020-01-21**
  - Fixed a regression affecting v5.18 and v5.19 where some users were experiencing client-side performance issues. This was mainly affecting users with more than 100 channels listed in the channel sidebar and with channels sorted alphabetically. [MM-20349](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-20349)
- **v5.19.0, released 2020-01-16**
  - Original 5.19.0 release

### Compatibility

#### Breaking Changes

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.18, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where email notifications were still sent in some cases while disabled in the user interface.

 - Fixed an issue where the height and width parameters in inline images didn't work.
 - Fixed an issue where the day picker in after/before search didn't honor the user's timezone override.
 - Fixed an issue where editing a post and hitting ``<enter>`` in code block saved the post automatically instead of adding a newline.
 - Fixed an issue where users were unable to close the Edit Channel Header modal when opened from the Intro Message.
 - Fixed an issue where opening the channel picker using CTRL+K and then focusing on the message box using CTRL+SHIFT+L did not close the channel picker.
 - Fixed an issue where the at-mention suggestions still highlighted the previous search but not the first suggestion in the list.
 - Fixed an issue where the at-mention autocomplete always opened up in the right-hand side reply thread, sometimes cutting off users in the list.
 - Fixed an issue with a notification badge count inconsistency when push notification setting was set to **All Activity**.
 - Fixed an issue where timestamps on 12-hour format had a leading zero.
 - Fixed an issue with an incorrect error message when attempting to add a bot to a channel if the bot was previously on the team.
 - Fixed an issue where the client license API generated a different ETag for every response.

### API Changes
 - Etag header was added to the API endpoint to get the client license.
 - Oath ``IsTrusted`` configuration can only be changed if the user has the ``manage_system`` permission.
 
### Known Issues
 - Client-side performance issues seen while typing.
 - On a server with a subpath, channel drop-down **Leave Channel** fails to leave the channel.
 - Importing theme colours from Slack gives an error.
 - Inviting multiple users with valid/allowed and invalid emails causes the invites for the valid users not to be sent.
 - Option to invite users by email is displayed even if email invitations are disabled.
 - Users may need to reinstall and delete cache on Classic apps if launching and logging into the app get stuck.
 - On a server using a subpath, the URL opens a blank page if the System Admin changes the Site URL in the System Console UI. To fix, the System Admin should restart the server.
 - Login does not work when Custom Terms of Service is enabled and MFA is enforced.
 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as away or offline in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
 - Searching stop words in quotes with Elasticsearch enabled returns more than just the searched terms.

## Release v5.18 - [Feature Release](/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

Mattermost v5.18.0 contains low to high level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

- **v5.18.2, released 2020-01-16**
  - Fixed an issue where server crashed when a user updated their Account Settings in a high availability cluster environment, and the corresponding ``user_updated`` event did not reach a guest user. [MM-21481](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21481)
- **v5.18.1, released 2020-01-08**
  - Mattermost v5.18.1 contains a high level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).
  - Fixed an issue where migrating accounts from email to SAML failed. [MM-21472](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21472)
- **v5.18.0, released 2019-12-16**
  - Original 5.18.0 release

### Compatibility
 
### Important Upgrade Notes
- Marking a post unread from the mobile app requires v1.26 or later. If using v5.18, but mobile is on v1.25 or earlier, marking a post unread from webapp/desktop will only be reflected on mobile the next time the app launches or is brought to the foreground.

### Breaking Changes
 - The Go module path of ``mattermost-server`` was changed to comply with the Go module version specification. Developers using Go modules with ``mattermost-server`` as a dependency must change the module and import paths to ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/v5`` when upgrade this dependency to `v5.18`. See https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules for further information.
 - Removed ``Team.InviteId`` from the related Websocket event and sanitized it on all team API endpoints for users without invite permissions.
 - Removed the ability to change the type of a channel using the ``PUT /channels/{channel_id}`` API endpoint. The new ``PUT /channels/{channel_id}/privacy`` endpoint should be used for that purpose.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.17, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights
 
#### ID Loaded push notifications (E20)
 - Allows push notifications to be delivered showing the full message contents that are fetched from the server once the notification is delivered to the device. This means that Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) or Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) cannot read the message contents since only a unique message ID is sent in the notification payload. 
 
#### Allow Plugin Upgrades
 - Added ability to upgrade plugins and prepackaged plugins via the marketplace.
 
#### Mark Posts as Unread
 - When marking a post as unread, the user will land on the unread post the next time they click on the relevant channel.
 
#### mmctl remote CLI tool
 - Allows a system admin to run commands when conventional access to the server via SSH isn't possible.

#### View Archived Channels (Beta)
 - View, share and search for content of archived channels. See more details [here](/administration/config-settings.html#allow-users-to-view-archived-channels-beta).

#### Guest Account SAML & LDAP Support (EE)
 - Provision Guests directly from AD/LDAP or SAML upon login. Guests will have no access to any teams or channels until they are assigned.

#### Actiance Improvements (E20)
 - Added events (such as post/file deletion and edit events) to Actiance Export to improve tracking within the Vantage report interface.

#### LDAP Group Sync upgraded to Beta phase (E20)
 - Previously in “Experimental” phase, the linking of AD/LDAP groups to Mattermost groups is now officially in “Beta” phase.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Disabled email notifications in Do Not Disturb mode.
 - Added support for showing a tooltip on public and private channel names that get truncated.
 - Added support for allowing in-line markdown images to open a preview window.
 - Added line numbers to code blocks that have syntax highlighting.
 - Added support for trimming leading/trailing whitespace on a channel name when a channel is created.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Updated CLI command "deleter user" to add ability to delete the given user's group memberships.
 - Created CLI command "config reset" to allow resetting the value of a config setting to its default value.
 
#### Integrations

 - Added user_name, team_domain and channel_name metadata when clicking an interactive button.
 - Extended EnsureBot helper function to include bot images.
 - Added support for a generic error message in interactive dialog responses.
 
#### Plugins

 - Added support for server version and minimum server version checks in helper methods for plugins.
 - Added support for returning results for individual plugins in **System Console > Search**.

#### Administration
 - Added support for System Administrators to control Teammate Name Display at the system level.
 - Added support for revoking Guest User Sessions when the Guest Accounts feature is disabled.
 - Added the ability to search in **System Console > Channels** and **System Console > Teams**.
 - Added the ability to add users as another user to the plugin API.
 - Restricted user access to ``/logs`` API endpoint.
 - Added "Remove team" and "Change role" options in Team Membership panel.
 - Added support for disabling channel settings for public and private toggle for default channels.

#### Enterprise Edition (EE)
 - Added SAML login events to the Audits Table.
 - Added support for configuration of SAML crypto hashing algorithms.
 - Added support for not allowing Guest invitations to teams that are managed by LDAP Group Sync.
 - Added support for custom post types to Compliance exports.

 - Fixed some bugs related to the [keyboard accessibility](/help/getting-started/accessibility.html) feature.
 - Fixed issues with Guest Accounts feature, such as an issue where the option to make guest users as team admins was erroneously provided in Manage Teams dialog on **System Console > Users**.
 - Fixed an issue where an opened emoji picker floated while the user scrolled in the channel.
 - Fixed an issue where "Your message is too long" warning on the right-hand side reply thread overlapped the Preview button.
 - Fixed an issue where hitting escape to close autocomplete also closed channel header modal.
 - Fixed an issue where negative search filter hypens and occasional random terms were highlighted in search results.
 - Fixed an issue where deactivating a user increased Monthly Active Users and Daily Active Users count by 1 in **System Console > Site Statistics**.
 - Fixed an issue where **Reporting > Statistics** showed 'Loading...' when the value for any of the statistics was zero.
 - Fixed an issue where converting a user to a bot via the command line tool (CLI) did not create an access token and could not be deleted.
 - Fixed an issue where archived channels displayed in **System Console -> Channels** page.

### Compatibility

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

 - Support for Internet Explorer (IE11) was removed. Learn more in our [forum post](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/mattermost-is-dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-ie11-in-v5-16/7575).
 
### Breaking Changes
 - The Mattermost Desktop v4.3.0 release includes a change to how desktop notifications are sent from non-secure URLs (http://). Organizations using non-secure Mattermost Servers (http://) will need to update to Mattermost Server versions 5.16.0+, 5.15.1, 5.14.4 or 5.9.5 (ESR) to continue receiving desktop notifications when using Mattermost Desktop v4.3.0 or later.
 - When enabling [Guest Accounts](/deployment/guest-accounts.html), all users who have the ability to invite users will be able to invite guests by default.  System admins will need to remove this permission on each role via **System Console > Permissions Schemes**.  In Mattermost Server version 5.17, the System admin will be the only role to automatically get the invite guest permission, however the fix will not be applicable in 5.16 due to database migration processes.

### Highlights

#### Guest Accounts
 - Provides a controlled and secure method for users outside of an organization to collaborate with their organization without allowing the guest to access proprietary or confidential information.

#### Plugin Marketplace
 - The integrations marketplace is built into the product and gives system administrators the ability to discover and install Mattermost plugins that are compatible with the server version you are running.  

#### Improved user management 
 - System Administrators can view a user's team memberships and add a user to additional teams from the System Console without having to be a member of the team.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added support for showing TIF image thumbnail previews.
 - Added the ability to remove the custom branding image.
 - Added support for showing channel links as links in email notifications.
 - Added support for direct message permalinks.
 - Changed recent date separators to read Today/Yesterday.

#### Import/Export
 - Added support for including the Theme property on ``UserTeamMemberships`` in bulk exports.

#### Search
 - Added support for excluding results from search.
 
#### Notifications
 - Enabled account related emails when ``SendEmailNotifications`` is set to false.
 
#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Added a ``integrity`` CLI command to verify database integrity.
 
#### Plugins
 - Added the ability for plugins to render custom embed views for posts.
 - Added support for including custom System Console components for plugins.
 - Added support for plugins to close the right-hand sidebar.
 
#### Integrations
 - Added support for introductory markdown paragraph in interactive dialogs.
 - Added a password type for interactive dialogs.
 - Added support for footer and footer_icon in attachments.
 - Added support for boolean elements in interactive dialogs.
 - Added support for a ``radio`` type in interactive dialogs.
 
#### Performance
 - Improved perceived performance of the emoji picker.
 - Improved post list performance by making thread comments be loaded only when needed.
 - Improved quick switcher experience to make the autocomplete feel more like a modal rather than a dropdown.

#### Administration
 - Added the ability for System Administrators to revoke all sessions from all users.
 - Added support for System Administrators to make public channels private and private channels public within the **System Console > User Management > Channel Configuration** page when [Experimental Groups feature](/administration/config-settings.html#groups-experimental) is enabled.
 - Added user Id information in the **System Console > Users** page.
 - Updated System Console plugin settings page to expose enable/disable setting.
 - Added ability for System Administrators to view a user's team memberships and add users to additional teams within **System Console > User Management > User Configuration**.

### Compatibility

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

 - We are removing support for Internet Explorer (IE11) in Mattermost v5.16.0, which releases on October 16, 2019. Learn more in our [forum post](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/mattermost-is-dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-ie11-in-v5-16/7575).
 
### Breaking Changes

 - Webhooks are now only displayed if the user is the creator of the webhook or a system administrator.
 - With the update from Google+ to Google People, system admins need to ensure the ``GoogleSettings.Scope`` config.json setting is set to ``profile email`` and ``UserAPIEndpoint`` setting should be set to ``https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/me?personFields=names,emailAddresses,nicknames,metadata`` per [updated documentation](/deployment/sso-google.html).

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.13, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Keyboard navigation and screen reader improvements

 - New keyboard navigation improvements enable you to move between app regions—like the post list, channel sidebar, and header—using F6 on the Desktop App and CTRL-F6 on a web browser. You can also use TAB, arrow keys, and ENTER to interact with buttons, links, and other elements in Mattermost.
 - Screen readers are now much more compatible with Mattermost. Buttons, links, and app regions now have accurate readouts that enable visually impaired users to use Mattermost productively with screen readers.
 - [Learn more](/help/getting-started/accessibility.html)

#### Bidirectional scrolling to land on oldest unread post
 - No more scrolling required to get to the oldest unread post. Now when the channel opens when there are unreads it opens at the new messages line, regardless of how many unreads exist since the last time the user viewed the channel.

#### Jira V2.1
 - Full list of features in v2.1: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira#jira-21-features.

#### System Console tools to manage LDAP Groups within Teams and Channels (EE)
 - New Team and Channel pages in the System Console allow administrators to easily manage teams and channels membership with LDAP Group Synchronization instead of using the CLI group commands released in v5.12.
 
#### Pre-packaged Plugins
 - [Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jenkins) for interacting with jobs and builds via slash commands in Mattermost.
 - [Antivirus plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-antivirus) for scanning files uploaded to Mattermost.
 - [GitLab plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab) for getting notifications in Mattermost about mentions, review requests and comments.

### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:

 - Under ``ElasticsearchSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``SkipTLSVerification`` to ignore certificate verification for Elasticsearch.
 
#### Open Source Components

 - Added ``moment-timezone`` in https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux/.

#### Database Changes

 - ``plugins`` type entries in the ``Jobs`` table will be purged on upgrade. This job was incorrectly configured to run every minute, spamming the table with mostly useless records. All old records will be removed on upgrade, and the job will run daily instead.

### Known Issues
 - Cannot leave any team when a default [primary team](/administration/config-settings.html#primary-team-experimental) is set.

 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as away or offline in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.

### Breaking changes since last release

 - If your plugin uses the ``DeleteEphemeralMessage`` plugin API, update it to accept a ``postId string`` parameter. See [documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/server/reference/#API.DeleteEphemeralPost) to learn more.
 - Image link and YouTube previews do not display unless **System Console > Enable Link Previews** is enabled. Please ensure that your Mattermost server is connected to the internet and has network access to the websites from which previews are expected to appear. [Learn more here](/administration/config-settings.html#enable-link-previews).
 - ``ExperimentalEnablePostMetadata`` setting was removed. Post metadata, including post dimensions, is now stored in the database to correct scroll position and eliminate scroll jumps as content loads in a channel.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.11, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Infinite Scroll
 - Read messages more easily. Older posts are loaded automatically as you scroll up instead of having to click the "Load more messages" button at the top of the screen. This feature is not supported on Internet Explorer (IE11).
 
#### Bot Accounts
 - Users no longer have to rely on creating fake user accounts to act as bots for integrations. Instead, create a real bot account and use it to generate bot access tokens to interact with users and complete tasks.
 - Users can can also use these bots to post to any channel in the system, whether it’s a private team, private channel or a direct message channel.
 - For Enterprise deployments, bot accounts no longer count as an active user towards licensing subscriptions.
 - To learn more about bot accounts, see [the documentation](https://mattermost.com/pl/default-bot-accounts).
 
#### Jira Plugin 2.0
 - Enhanced existing plugin for a deep two-way integration between Jira and Mattermost.
 - Send notifications for Jira issue creation, issue updates and comments to Mattermost channels.
 - Users can also take quick actions in Mattermost, including creating Jira issues, attaching Mattermost messages to Jira issues, and transitioning issues via slash commands.
 - For a full feature set for 2.0, see https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira#jira-20-features.
 
#### Pre-packaged Plugins
 - New pre-packaged plugins bundled with this Mattermost release include:
   - [GitHub plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-github) for notifications, reminders and slash commands to stay up-to-date on issues and pull requests. Supports GitHub SaaS and Enterprise versions.
   - [Autolink plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink) to automatically hyperlink text, such as adding links to your issue tracker when someone posts an issue key or number.
   - [Custom Attributes plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes) to add custom attributes in the user profile popover.
   - [Welcome Bot plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-welcomebot) to improve onboarding and HR processes by adding a Welcome Bot that helps add new team members to channels.
   - [Amazon SNS CloudWatch plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-aws-sns) to send alert notifications from [Amazon AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to Mattermost channels via AWS SNS.

#### System Console Reorganization
 - Informational architecture restructure of the System Console to make a more logical flow to the settings and to provide a more cohesive experience for hiding features on the Mattermost Private Cloud product, where the system admin should not have access to change configurations that affect the environment directly.

#### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
 - We are gathering user feedback to help improve user experience and hear directly from our users. The feature can be disabled via **System Console > Plugins > Net Promoter Score**.
 
#### AD/LDAP Group Sync Removals (Enterprise Edition E20)
 - System Admins can manage the membership of private teams and channels with AD/LDAP groups, eliminating the need to individually add and remove members. Users in the groups are automatically removed from the team or channel when removed from an associated group.
 
#### User/Channel Search & Autocomplete in Elasticsearch (Enterprise Edition E20)
 - Added new settings in **System Console > Elasticsearch** to enable [Elasticsearch](/deployment/elasticsearch.html) for autocompletion queries. When enabled, Elasticsearch uses its indexed data for user/channel search queries and autocomplete queries.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added an option to add a user to a channel from the profile popover.
 - Removed ``@`` for full name display in push notifications.
 
#### Plugins
 - Added support for Markdown in plugin System Console help text fields.
 - Added support for plugins to override ephemeral posts.

#### Localization
 - Promoted Polish language to "official".

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Added a ``command modify`` CLI command to modify slash commands.
 - Added a ``mattermost user convert --bot`` CLI command to convert user accounts to bot accounts.
 - Implemented a new command ``config migrate`` for migrating configuration to and from the database.
 - For AD/LDAP Group Sync, added the following CLI commands:
   - ``group team enable`` to add the ability to switch a team to be group-constrained.
   - ``group team disable``to add the ability to disable group constraint on the specified team.
   - ``group team list`` to list the groups associated with a team.
   - ``group team status`` to show the group constraint status of the specified team.
   - ``group channel enable`` to add the ability to switch a channel to be group-constrained.
   - ``group channel disable`` to disable group constraint on the specified channel.
   - ``group channel list`` to list the groups associated with a channel.
   - ``group channel status`` to show the group constraint status of the specified channel.
 
#### Administration
 - Added support for running two Mattermost instances on the same domain using subpaths.
 - Added support for importing threads from Slack.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where releasing a mouse click while the cursor was outside of the Rename Channel modal would close the modal.
 - Fixed an issue where a whitepage occured after uploading a plugin with an invalid ``settings_schema`` value.
 - Fixed an issue where the announcement banner overlapped channel content.
 - Fixed an issue where license expiration notice banner could not be dismissed prior to the license expiration date.
 - Fixed an issue where the channel switcher autocomplete didn't function properly when autocompleting the name of a person who was the first person named in a group message channel.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:

 - Under ``"PluginSettings":`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``"EnableHealthCheck": true``, to ensure all plugins are periodically monitored, and restarted or deactivated based on their health status.

   - Added ``"EnableConsole": true``, ``"ConsoleLevel": "DEBUG"``, ``"ConsoleJson": true``, ``"EnableFile": true``, ``"FileLevel": "INFO"``, ``"FileJson": true``, and ``"FileLocation": ""``, to implement a structured logger to keep track of push notifications.
 - Under ``"ServiceSettings":`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``"EnableBotAccountCreation": false`` to enable bot account creation.
   - Added ``"DisableBotsWhenOwnerIsDeactivated": true`` to disable bots automatically when the owner is deactivated.

 - LDAP Group Sync:
    - Added API endpoints ``getGroupsByChannel`` and ``GetGroupsByTeam`` to retrieve groups by team and by channel.
    - Added ``group_constrained`` API to both ``/users`` and ``/users/search`` endpoints to be able to limit users listed to those allowed by group-constraints.
    - Added the ``GetGroups`` API endpoint to retrieve lists of groups with searching, pagination, and member counts.
 - Disabled Team InviteID modification via Create/Update actions and moved it to a dedicated API endpoint.
    
#### Plugin API v4 Changes
 - Added ``KVCompareAndSet(key string, old []byte, new []byte)`` to Plugin API to add support for transactional semantics with KV Store in plugin framework.

## Release v5.11 - Quality Release

Mattermost v5.11.0 contains low level security fixes. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

- **v5.11.1, released 2019-06-20** 
  - Mattermost v5.11.1 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](/administration/upgrade.html) is highly recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).
- **v5.11.0, released 2019-05-16**
  - Original 5.11.0 release

### Breaking changes since last release

 - If your integration uses ``Update.Props == nil`` to clear ``Props``, this will no longer work in 5.11+. Instead, use ``Update.Props == {}`` to clear properties. This change was made because ``Update.Props == nil`` unintentionally cleared all ``Props``, such as the profile picture, instead of preserving them.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.10, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where plugin settings link didn't appear until refresh after uploading a plugin in the System Console.
 - Fixed an issue where **System Console** > **Users** bottom section of "user actions" menu was cut off for the last three users in the screen.
 - Fixed an issue where corners on image previews were squared instead of rounded.
 - Fixed an issue where the hover effect was missing on images.
 - Fixed an issue where a post action (via button or menu) reset the profile picture of the webhook post.
 - Fixed an issue where a flagged post containing only file attachments didn't render in the sidebar until loaded in the centre.
 - Fixed an issue where some strings in channel settings weren't localizable.
 - Fixed an issue where clicking "Open" downloaded an image instead of opening it.
 - Fixed an issue where an at-mention user autocomplete overlapped with the channel header when drafting a long message containing a file attachment.
 - Fixed an issue where the reply bar showed gaps between posts in compact view.
 - Fixed an issue where markdown preview of nested lists displayed differently from styling in posted message.
 - Fixed an issue where Safari suggested auto-corrections in the channel switcher.
 - Fixed an issue on Safari where the mention badge count didn't update immediately.
 - Fixed an issue where the post action menu overlapped with posts on iOS/Safari on mobile view.
 - Fixed an issue where interactive dialog's description text colour was difficult to see on dark themes.
 - Fixed an issue where delete permissions for custom emoji team admin role were not always granted.
 - Fixed an issue with a slight scroll pop on reaching loading indictor of search results.
 - Fixed an issue where adding a user to a channel that is in the unreads section caused the channel to become read in the user's view.
 - Fixed an issue where the channel menu dropdown icon had an unnecessary tooltip.
 - Fixed an issue on LDAP Groups where adding a group to a team provided an unnecessary permission confirmation modal.
 - Fixed an issue on mobile view where clicking on the attachment icon didn't bring up the dropdown menu.

### Known Issues
 - Buttons inside ephemeral posts are not clickable / functional on the mobile app.
 - On a server using a subpath, the URL opens a blank page if the system admin changes the Site URL in the System Console UI. The system admin should restart the server to fix it.

### Breaking Changes since last release

 - If **DisableLegacyMfa** setting in ``config.json`` is set to ``true`` and multi-factor authentication is enabled, ensure your users have upgraded to mobile app version 1.17 or later. Otherwise, users who have MFA enabled may not be able to log in successfully. See [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.
 - The public IP of the Mattermost application server is considered a reserved IP for additional security hardening in the context of untrusted external requests such as Open Graph metadata, webhooks or slash commands. See [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from another release than 5.8, please read the [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Breaking Changes since the last release

 - Replaced WebRTC prototype with other video and audio calling solutions. [Learn more here](/deployment/video-and-audio-calling.html).
 - Removed support for IE11 Mobile View due to low usage and instability in order to invest that effort in maintaining a high quality experience on other more used browsers. End users on IE11 will thus have an increased minimum screen size.
 - If EnablePublicChannelsMaterialization setting in config.json is set to false, an offline migration prior to upgrade may be required to synchronize the materialized table for public channels to increase channel search performance in the channel switcher (CTRL/CMD+K), channel autocomplete (~) and elsewhere in the UI. See [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from another release than 5.5, please read the [Important Upgrade Notes](/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Breaking Changes since the last release

- All API v3 endpoints have been removed. [See documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/schema) to learn more about how to migrate your integrations to API v4. [Ticket #8708](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-8708).
- `platform` binary has been renamed to mattermost for a clearer install and upgrade experience. **You should point your `systemd` service file at the new `mattermost` binary.** All command line tools, including the bulk loading tool and developer tools, have also been renamed from platform to mattermost. [Ticket #9985](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9985).
- A Mattermost user setting to configure desktop notification duration in **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Desktop Notifications** has been removed.
- Slash commands configured to receive a GET request now have the payload encoded in the query string instead of receiving it in the body of the request, consistent with standard HTTP requests. Although unlikely, this could break custom slash commands that use GET requests incorrectly. [Ticket #10201](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10201).
- A new `config.json` setting to whitelist types of protocols for auto-linking has been added. [Ticket #9547](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9547).

### Compatibility

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

- All API v3 endpoints have been deprecated, and scheduled for removal in Mattermost v5.0.
- The `mentionKeys` prop in post type plugins is now removed to fix case sensitive mention highlighting. Plugins can retrieve the `mentionKeys` prop from the store as needed.
- The permanent query parameter of the DELETE `/teams/{team_id}` APIv4 endpoint is not removed as previously announced, given customer and community feedback.
- As Mattermost moves to a role based permissions system in v4.8, a number of configuration settings will be migrated to roles in the database, and changing their `config.json` values will no longer take effect. These permissions can still be modified by their respective System Console settings. The `config.json` settings to be migrated are:
  - RestrictPublicChannelManagement
  - RestrictPrivateChannelManagement
  - RestrictPublicChannelCreation
  - RestrictPrivateChannelCreation
  - RestrictPublicChannelDeletion
  - RestrictPrivateChannelDeletion
  - RestrictPrivateChannelManageMembers
  - EnableTeamCreation
  - EnableOnlyAdminIntegrations
  - RestrictPostDelete
  - AllowEditPost
  - RestrictTeamInvite

For a list of past and upcoming deprecated features, [see our website](https://about.mattermost.com/deprecated-features/).

#### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:

 - Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"ImageProxyType": ""`, `"ImageProxyOptions": ""`, and `"ImageProxyURL": ""` to ensure posts served to the client will have their markdown modified such that all images are loaded through a proxy.
    - Added `"ExperimentalGroupUnreadChannels": disabled` to show an unread channel section in the webapp sidebar. The setting must first be enabled by the System Admin, by replacing `disabled` with either `default_off` or `default_on`.
    - Added `"ExperimentalEnableDefaultChannelLeaveJoinMessages": true` that allows disabling of leave/join messages in the default channel, usually Town Square.
 - Under `RateLimitingSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"VaryByUser": false`, a user-based rate limiting, to rate limit on token and on userID.

### API Changes

 - It is required that any new integrations use API v4 endpoints. For more details, and for a complete list of available endpoints, see [https://api.mattermost.com/](https://api.mattermost.com/).
 - All API v3 endpoints have been deprecated, and scheduled for removal in Mattermost v5.0.

#### RESTful API v4 Changes

 - Added `GetChannelByName` and `GetTeamByName` to auto lowercase team and channel names in API requests. This ensures that the channel name is automatically lowercased for endpoints taking team or channel names as URL parameters.
 - Added `POST /emoji/search`, `GET /emojis/name/{emoji_name}`, and `GET /emoji/autocomplete` to add consistency with user search/autocomplete endpoints. These API endpoints ensure that the benefits of `GET` for important performance related actions such as autocompleting are included.
 - Added `/users/tokens/search` to allow System Admin to be able to find, manage and revoke personal access tokens as needed. This endpoint gets all tokens for all users if one has the `manage_system` permission.

### WebSocket Event Changes

 - Added `delete_team` web socket event to notify client whenever a team is deleted (e.g. via API call).

### Database Changes

**Users Table:**

 - Increased size of `Position` field from 35 to 128 characters.

**OAuthAuthData Table:**

 - Increased size of `State` field from 128 to 1024 characters.

**ChannelMemberHistory Table:**

 - Removed `Username` column.

### Known Issues

- User can receive a video call from another browser tab while already on a call.
- Jump link in search results does not always jump to display the expected post.
- Status may sometimes get stuck as away or offline in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.

- Numbered lists can sometimes extend beyond the normal post area.
- Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
- Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.
- `[WARN] plugin sandboxing is not supported. plugins will run with the same access level as the server` log message is created when sandboxing isn't enabled for plugins. If you don't use plugins, you can ignore this message. If you have plugins enabled, [learn how to enable sandboxing](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/security/#sandboxing).

### Compatibility

#### Breaking Changes

1 - Mattermost now handles multiple content types for integrations, including plaintext content type. If your integration suddenly prints the JSON payload data instead of rendering the generated message, make sure your integration is returning the `application/json` content-type to retain previous behavior.

2 - By default, user-supplied URLs such as those used for Open Graph metadata, webhooks, or slash commands will no longer be allowed to connect to reserved IP addresses including loopback or link-local addresses used for internal networks.

This change may cause private integrations to break in testing environments, which may point to a URL such as http://127.0.0.1:1021/my-command.

If you point private integrations to such URLs, you may whitelist such domains, IP addresses, or CIDR notations via the [AllowedUntrustedInternalConnections config setting](/administration/config-settings.html#allow-untrusted-internal-connections-to) in your local environment. Although not recommended, you may also whitelist the addresses in your production environments. See [documentation to learn more](/administration/config-settings.html#allow-untrusted-internal-connections-to).

Push notification, OAuth 2.0 and WebRTC server URLs are trusted and not affected by this setting.

3 - Uploaded file attachments are now grouped by day and stored in `/data/<date-of-upload-as-YYYYMMDD>/teams/...` of your file storage system.

4 - Mattermost `/platform` repo has been separated to `/mattermost-webapp` and `/mattermost-server`. This may affect you if you have a private fork of the `/platform` repo. [More details here](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/mattermost-separating-platform-into-two-repositories-on-september-6th/3708).

#### Removed and Deprecated Features
- All APIv3 endpoints are scheduled for removal on January 16, 2018.

  - Added `ExperimentalTownSquareIsReadOnly: false` to set if Town Square is a read-only channel. Applies to all teams in the Mattermost server. This setting is Beta and may be replaced or removed in a future release.
- Added `ThemeSettings` in `config.json`. These settings are Beta and may be replaced or removed in a future release.
  - Added `"EnableThemeSelection": true` to set whether end users can change their Mattermost theme.
  - Added `"DefaultTheme": "default"` to set default theme for new users.
  - Added `"AllowCustomThemes": true` to set whether end users can set a custom theme.

### Compatibility

#### Breaking Changes

- If you are using NGINX as a proxy for the Mattermost Server, replace the `location /api/v3/users/websocket {` line with `location ~ /api/v[0-9]+/(users/)?websocket$ {` in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost` NGINX configuration file. [See documentation to learn more](/install/install-ubuntu-1404.html#configuring-nginx-as-a-proxy-for-mattermost-server).
- If you are upgrading a High Availability Cluster: When upgrading from 3.10 or earlier to 4.0 or later, you must manually add new items to the *ClusterSettings* section of your existing ``config.json``. For more information about this, see the *Upgrading to Version 4.0 and Later* section of :doc:`../deployment/cluster`.
 - Microsoft Edge v39 and earlier (EdgeHTML v14 and earlier) has [an issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/8546263/) that may case errors during account creation, login and if MFA is enforced. We recommend upgrading to Edge v40 (or EdgeHTML v15).

#### Removed and deprecated features
- System Console settings in **Files > Images** removed. This includes:
  - Image preview height and width
  - Profile picture height and width
  - Image thumbnail height and width
- Font setting in Account Settings > Display removed.
- Account Settings option **Display** > **Teammate Name Display** moved to the System Console.
- All APIv3 endpoints are scheduled for removal on January 16, 2018.

For a list of past and upcoming deprecated features, [see our website](https://about.mattermost.com/deprecated-features/).

#### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

**Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition**:

- Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Added `"EnableEmojiPicker": true` to control whether emoji picker is enabled on the server. Enabling the emoji picker with a large number of custom emoji may slow down performance.
   - Added `"EnableChannelViewedMessages": true` to control whether `channel_viewed` WebSocket event is sent, which syncs unreads across clients and devices. Setting to false can lead to higher performance in large deployments.
   - Added `"EnableAPIv3": true` to control whether version 3 endpoints of the REST API are allowed on the server. If the setting is disabled, integrations that rely on API v3 will fail and can then be identified for migration to API v4.
- Under `TeamSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Added `"TeammateNameDisplay": "username"` to set how to display users' names in posts and the Direct Messages list. Deployments with LDAP or SAML enabled will have this set to `full_name` by default for better experience.
- Under `FileSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Removed System Console settings in **Files > Images**, including:
     - `"ThumbnailWidth": 120`
     - `"ThumbnailHeight": 100`
     - `"PreviewWidth": 1024`
     - `"PreviewHeight": 0`
     - `"ProfileWidth": 128`
     - `"ProfileHeight": 128`
- Under `SqlSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Modified `"QueryTimeout": 30` to also support query timeouts on PostgreSQL, in addition to MySQL.

**Additional Changes to Enterprise Edition**:

- Under `ClusterSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Added `"ClusterName": ""` to set the cluster to join by name. Only nodes with the same cluster name will join together. This is to support Blue-Green deployments or staging pointing to the same database.
   - Added `"OverrideHostname": ""` to override the hostname of this server with this property. It is not recommended to override the Hostname unless needed.
   - Added `"UseIpAddress": true` to control whether the cluster attempts to communicate using the IP Address.
   - Added `"UseExperimentalGossip": false` to control whether the server attempts to communicate via the gossip protocol over the gossip port.
   - Added `"ReadOnlyConfig": true` to control whether changes made to settings in the System Console are ignored. When running in production it is recommended to set this value to true.
   - Added `"GossipPort": 8074` to set the port used for the gossip protocol. Both UDP and TCP should be allowed on this port.
   - Added `"StreamingPort": 8075` to set the port used for streaming data between servers.
   - Removed ``"InterNodeListenAddress": ":8075"`` as this setting is no longer used.
   - Removed ``"InterNodeUrls": []`` as this setting is no longer used.

### API v4 Changes
- Mattermost 4.0 has a stable release of API v4 endpoints. It is recommended that any new integrations use the v4 endpoints. For more details, and for a complete list of available endpoints, see [https://api.mattermost.com/](https://api.mattermost.com/).
- All APIv3 endpoints are scheduled for removal on January 16, 2018.

**Added routes (API v4)**
- `GET` at `/teams/invite/{invite_id}`
  - To retrieve information about a team (including the name and id) corresponding to an invite_id.

**Modified routes (API v4)**
- `DELETE` at `/teams/{team_id}`
  - Added an optional query parameter, `permanent`, to permanently delete a team for compliance reasons.
- `GET` at `/users`
  - Added the `sort` query parameter to add basic sorting when selecting users on a team.
- `GET` at `/emoji`
  - Added paging to the `/emoji` call for increased performance.
- `POST` at `/teams/{team_id}/import`
   - Updated to return a JSON body with the import results under a `results` JSON field to allow more data to be returned in the future without breaking changes.

### Websocket Event Changes

**Added:**
- `channel_updated` that occurs each time channel information is updated (such as name or header), so that the changes are propagated across clients.
- `channel_viewed` that occurs each time you view a channel, propagating the event to all clients and devices and syncing unreads.

### Known Issues

- Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
- Edge overlays desktop notification sound and system notification sound.
- Clicking on a channel during the tutorial makes the tutorial disappear.
- User can receive a video call from another browser tab while already on a call.
- Search autocomplete picker is broken on Classic Android app.
- Jump link in search results does not always jump to display the expected post.
- First load of the emoji picker is slow on low-speed connections or on deployments with hundreds of custom emoji.

- Certain code block labels don't appear while scrolling on iOS mobile web.
- Outgoing webhooks do not fire when posts have no text content.
- A public channel doesn't always show up in another browser tab or client until after refresh.
- Null values in Slack attachments cause a 500 error for incoming webhooks.
- Keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+A does not close Account Settings.
- Deleted message doesn't clear unreads or unread mentions.
- Changing the search term in the More Direct Messages modal doesn't reset the page.
- Status may sometimes get stuck as away or offline in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.
- Cannot delete or edit parent posts in right-hand side reply threads.
- Empty cells in Markdown tables render incorrectly.
- `platform user deleteall` CLI command expects a user as an argument.

### Compatibility
Changes from v3.3 to v3.4:

**Special Note**

(Only affects servers with public links enabled) After upgrading to v3.4, existing public links will no longer be valid. This is because in past versions, when the Public Link Salt was regenerated existing public links were not invalidated. Now, when the salt is regenerated, existing links are made invalid.

#### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json` or the System Console.

**Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition**:

 - Under `EmailSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"EnableEmailBatching": false` to enable batching of email notifications configurable in Account Settings. To enable email batching, the `SiteURL` field must be filled out and `Enable` under `ClusterSettings` must be set to `false` to disable high availability mode.
    - Added `"EmailBatchingBufferSize": 256` to specify the maximum number of notifications batched into a single email.
    - Added `"EmailBatchingInterval": 30` to specify the maximum frequency, in seconds, which the batching job checks for new notifications.

 - Under `LogSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"EnableDiagnostics": true` to increase reliability and performance of Mattermost for your deployment configuration by sending encrypted [error reporting and diagnostic information](/administration/config-settings.html#enable-diagnostics-and-error-reporting) to Mattermost, Inc.

**Additional Changes to Enterprise Edition:**

The following config settings will only work on servers with an Enterprise License that has the feature enabled.

- Under `LdapSettings` in `config.json`:
    - `"FirstNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field
    - `"LastNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field
- Under `SamlSettings` in `config.json`:
    - `"FirstNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field
    - `"LastNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field

### Database Changes from v3.3 to v3.4

**Status Table**

 - Added `Manual` column.
 - Added `ActiveChannel` column.

### API Changes from v3.3 to v3.4

**New routes:**
 - Added `GET` at `/oauth/authorized`
     - Returns the OAuth2 Apps authorized by the user.  On success it returns a list of sanitized OAuth2 Authorized Apps by the user.
 - Added `POST` at `/oauth/"+clientId+"/deauthorize`
     - Deauthorizes a user on an OAuth 2.0 app, where `clientId` corresponds to the application. Returns status OK on success or an AppError on fail.
 - Added `POST` at `/oauth/"+clientId+"/regen_secret`
     - Generates a new OAuth App Client Secret, where `clientId` corresponds to the application. Returns an OAuth2 App on success. Must be authenticated as a user and the same user who registered the app or a System Admin.
 - Added `POST` at `/admin/ldap_test`
     - Will run a connection test on the current LDAP settings. It will return the standard OK response if settings work. Otherwise it will return an appropriate error.
 - Added `POST` at `/users/status/set_active_channel`
     - Sets the Status.ActiveChannel field which is used to tell if the user is actively viewing a channel or not.
 - Added `GET` at `/admin/recently_active_users/{teamId}`
     - Returns a list of recent active users.

### Known Issues

- Upgrading from 3.2 to 3.4 will be incomplete due to a migration code not being run properly. You can either:
    - Upgrade from 3.2 to 3.3 and then from 3.3 to 3.4, or
    - Upgrade from 3.2 to 3.4, then run the following SQL query to make Mattermost rerun upgrade steps that were not properly completed: `UPDATE Systems SET Value = '3.1.0' WHERE Name = 'Version';`
- Deleted messages don't disappear from the channel for the user who deleted the message, if the message was previously edited and right hand sidebar is open.
- A single collapsed link or image preview re-opens after refresh.
- Files sent in private chat to members in a different team are not accessible.
- YouTube video links show as “Video not found” on Desktop App if "Allow mixed content" is turned on.
- “More” option under Direct Message list no longer shows count of team members not in your direct message list.
- On Firefox, CTRL/CMD+U keyboard shortcut to upload a file doesn’t work.
- Webhook attachments don’t show up in search results.
- Messages sometimes don't appear deleted until the page is refreshed.
- When joining a channel from a public link, the page sometimes loads for a long time and requires a refresh.

## Release v1.2.1

- **Released:** 2015-11-16

### Security Notice

Mattermost v1.2.1 is a Quality Release addressing a security issue in v1.2.0 affecting a newly introduced outgoing webhooks feature. Specifically, in v1.2.0 there was a check missing from outgoing webhooks, so a team member creating outgoing webhooks could in theory find a way to listen to messages in private channels containing popular words like "a", "the", "at", etc. For added security, Mattermost v1.2.1 now installs with incoming and outgoing webhooks disabled by default.

To limit the impact of this security issue, Mattermost v1.2.0 has been removed from the source repo. It is recommended that anyone who's installed v1.2.0 upgrade to v1.2.1 via [the procedure described in the Mattermost Upgrade Guide](/administration/upgrade.html#upgrade-team-edition-for-2-2-x-and-earlier).

- A community application, [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge?files=1), shows how to use webhooks to connect Mattermost with IRC

#### Search Scope Modifiers

- Adding search term `in:[channel_url_name]` now limits searches within a specific channel
- Adding search term `from:[username]` now limits searches to messages from a specific user

#### Syntax Highlighting

- Syntax highlight for code blocks now available for `Diff, Apache, Makefile, HTTP, JSON, Markdown, JavaScript, CSS, nginx, ObjectiveC, Python, XML, Perl, Bash, PHP, CoffeeScript, C, SQL, Go, Ruby, Java, and ini`

## Release v1.2.0 (Redacted Release)

- **Final release:** 2015-11-16 (**Note:** This release was removed from public availability and replaced by v1.2.1 owing to a security issue with the new outgoing webhooks feature. See v1.2.1 Release Notes for details).

## Release v1.1.1 (Quality Release)

Released 2015-10-20

### About Quality Releases

This is a Quality Release (v1.1.1) and recommended only for users needing a fix to the specific issue listed below. All other users should use the most recent major stable build release (v1.1.0).

[View more information on Mattermost release numbering](/process/release-process.html#release-numbering).

### Release Purpose

#### Provide option for upgrading database from Mattermost v0.7 to v1.1

Upgrading Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1 originally required installing Mattermost v1.0 to upgrade from the Mattermost v0.7 database, followed by an install of Mattermost v1.1.

This was problematic for installing Mattermost with GitLab omnibus since GitLab 8.0 contained Mattermost v0.7 and GitLab 8.1 was to include Mattermost v1.1

Therefore Mattermost v1.1.1 was created that can upgrade the database in Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1 directly.

Users who configured Mattermost v0.7 within GitLab via the `config.json` file should consult [documentation on upgrading configurations from Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1](/administration/upgrade.html#upgrade-team-edition-for-2-2-x-and-earlier).

#### Removes 32-char limit on salts

Mattermost v1.1 introduced a 32-char limit on salts that broke the salt generating in GitLab and this restriction was removed for 1.1.1.

## Release v1.1.0

Released: 2015-10-16

### Release Highlights

#### Incoming Webhooks

Mattermost now supports incoming webhooks for channels and private groups. This developer feature is available from the Account Settings -> Integrations menu. Documentation on how developers can use the webhook functionality to build custom integrations, along with samples, is available at https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/integration.html.

### Improvements

### Compatibility

#### Config.json Changes from v1.0 to v1.1

##### Service Settings

Multiple settings were added to `config.json` and System Console UI. Prior to upgrading the Mattermost binaries from the previous versions, these options would need to be manually updated in existing config.json file. This is a list of changes and their new default values in a fresh install:

  - Added: `"EnablePostIconOverride": false` to control whether webhooks can override profile pictures
  - Added: `"EnablePostUsernameOverride": false` to control whether webhooks can override profile pictures
  - Added: `"EnableSecurityFixAlert": true` to control whether the system is alerted to security updates

#### Database Changes from v1.0 to v1.1

## Release v0.7.0 (Beta1)

Released 2015-09-05

### Release Highlights

#### Improved GitLab Mattermost support

Following the release of Mattermost v0.6.0 Alpha, GitLab 7.14 offered an automated install of Mattermost with GitLab Single Sign-On (co-branded as "GitLab Mattermost") in its omnibus installer.

New features, improvements, and bug fixes recommended by the GitLab community were incorporated into Mattermost v0.7.0 Beta1--in particular, extending support of GitLab SSO to team creation, and restricting team creation to users with verified emails from a configurable list of domains.

#### Slack Import (Preview)

Preview of Slack import functionality supports the processing of an "Export" file from Slack containing account information and public channel archives from a Slack team.

- In the feature preview, emails and usernames from Slack are used to create new Mattermost accounts, which users can activate by going to the Password Reset screen in Mattermost to set new credentials.
- Once logged in, users will have access to previous Slack messages shared in public channels, now imported to Mattermost.

Limitations:

- Slack does not export files or images your team has stored in Slack's database. Mattermost will provide links to the location of your assets in Slack's web UI.
- Slack does not export any content from private groups or direct messages that your team has stored in Slack's database.
- The Preview release of Slack Import does not offer pre-checks or roll-back and will not import Slack accounts with username or email address collisions with existing Mattermost accounts. Also, Slack channel names with underscores will not import. Also, mentions do not yet resolve as Mattermost usernames (still show Slack ID). These issues are being addressed in [Mattermost v0.8.0 Migration Support](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-22?filter=10002).
