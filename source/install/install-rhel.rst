.. note::

  You need a PostgreSQL database. See the :doc:`database preparation </install/prepare-mattermost-database>` documentation for details on this prerequisite.

A Mattermost deployment includes 4 steps: `download <#download>`__, `install <#install>`__, `setup <#setup>`__, and `update <#updates>`__.

Download the latest Mattermost Server tarball
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: download-latest-tarball.rst

Install
-------

Ahead of installing the Mattermost Server, it’s good practice to update all your repositories and, where required, update existing packages by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf upgrade

After any updates, and any system reboots, are complete, install the Mattermost Server.

Setup

Modify SELinux settings
-----------------------

When deploying Mattermost from RHEL9, which has SELinux running with enforceing mode enabled by default, additional configuration is required the SELinux policy is being enforced and denies access based on SELinux policy rules.

First, ensure that SELinux is enabled and in enforcing mode by running the ``sestatus`` command. If it's ``enforcing``, you'll need to configure it properly.

Set the correct contexts for ``/opt/mattermost``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SELinux enforces security contexts for files and directories. To label your Mattermost directory as safe, you'll need to set an appropriate SELinux context.

1. Check current context by running ``ls -Z /opt/mattermost``. When you see something like ``drwxr-xr-x. root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 mattermost`` returned, the ``default_t`` indicates that SELinux doesn't know what this directory is for.
2. Set a safe context by assigning a SELinux type that's compatible with web services or applications by running ``sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/opt/mattermost(/.*)?"``. A common one is ``httpd_sys_content_t``, used for serving files. Ensure you match the directory and its contents recursively. Run the ``sudo restorecon -R /opt/mattermost`` to apply the changes.

Allow Mattermost to bind to ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Mattermost needs specific ports (e.g., 8065), ensure that SELinux allows it by allowing Mattermost to bind to ports. Run the ``sudo semanage port -l | grep 8065`` command, and if the port's not listed, you'll need to add it by running ``sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8065``, replacing the ``8065`` with the required port.

Handle custom policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Mattermost requires actions that SELinux blocks, you'll need to generate a custom policy. 

1. Check for SELinux denials first in the logs by running ``sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent``, or by checking the audit log: ``sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep denied``.

2. If needed, generate a policy module by installing ``audit2allow`` to generate policies automatically.

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo yum install -y policycoreutils-python-utils
  sudo grep mattermost /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mattermost_policy
  sudo semodule -i mattermost_policy.pp

Test the configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restart Mattermost to confirm the configuation works as expected by running ``sudo systemctl restart mattermost``. In the case of failures, revisit the logs to identify other SELinux-related issues.

.. tip::

  Need Mattermost working quickly for testing purposes? You can change SELinux to permissive mode by running the ``sudo setenforce 0``. command where policies aren't enforced, only logged. This command changes the SELinux mode to "permissive". While in permissive mode, policies aren't enforced, and violations are logged instead of being blocked. This can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting issues related to SELinux policies. Ensure you re-enable enforcing mode once context is working as needed by running the ``sudo setenforce 1`` command.

See the following SELinux resources for additional details:

Updates
-------

Updating your Mattermost Server installation when using the tarball requires several manual steps. See the :doc:`upgrade Mattermost Server </upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server>` documentation for details.

Remove Mattermost
------------------

If you wish to remove the Mattermost Server for any reason, you must stop the Mattermost Server, back up all important files, and then run this command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo rm /opt/mattermost

.. note::

	Depending on your configuration, there are several important folders in ``/opt/mattermost`` to backup. These are ``config``, ``logs``, ``plugins``, ``client/plugins``, and ``data``. We strongly recommend you back up these locations before running the ``rm`` command.

You may also remove the Mattermost systemd unit file and the user/group created for running the application.
