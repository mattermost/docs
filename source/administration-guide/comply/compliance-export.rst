Mattermost Enterprise customers can archive history or transfer message data to third-party systems for auditing and compliance purposes with compliance exports. Supported integrations include `Smarsh (Actiance) Vantage <#actiance-xml>`__, `Global Relay <#global-relay-eml>`__, and `Proofpoint <#proofpoint>`__. 

From Mattermost v10.5, compliance exports include performance improvements for large daily data sets with changes affecting output formats, system performance, and logic. Compliance exports provide compliance teams complete information to reconstruct the state of a channel, and to determine who had visibility on an initial message, or when the message was edited or deleted. Compliance teams can track a message by its MessageId as it is edited or deleted, and across batches and exports periods.

Overview
---------

Compliance exports are produced from the System Console, and contain all messages including:

- Messages sent in direct message channels
- File uploads
- Posts from plugins
- Posts from bots/webhooks

Exports include information on channel member history at the time the message was posted.

Set up guide
------------

Use the following guides to configure exports for `CSV <#csv>`__, `Smarsh / Actiance XML <#actiance-xml>`__, `Global Relay EML <#global-relay-eml>`__, or `Proofpoint <#proofpoint>`__.

.. note::

   - For self-hosted deployments, compliance exports are written to the ``exports`` subdirectory of the configured filestore in the chosen format. This will either be in the :ref:`Local Storage directory <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:file storage>` or the Mattermost S3 bucket if S3 storage is configured.
   - Alternatively, you can specify an alternate filestore target and generate an S3 presigned URL for compliance exports. See the :ref:`dedicated export filestore target <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:enable dedicated export filestore target>` configuration settings documentation for details.
   - Compliance exports don't contain posts sent before the feature was enabled. For self-hosted deployments, you can export past history via the ``export`` :doc:`command line tool <../manage/command-line-tools>`. 

CSV
~~~~

1. Go to **System Console > Compliance > Compliance Export**.
2. Set **Enable Compliance Exports** to **true**.
3. Set the **Compliance Export time**. This is the start time of the daily scheduled compliance export job and must be a 24-hour time stamp in the form ``HH:MM``. Choose a time when fewer people are using your system.
4. Set the export file format to **CSV**.
5. Select **Save**.

.. tab:: From Mattermost v10.5
   :parse-titles:

   You can review export job status in the System Console.

   When the daily compliance export job is finished, a parent directory is created named based on when the export was started and the ``startTimestamp`` and ``endTimestamp`` of the export, e.g, ``administration-guide/comply/compliance-export-2024-08-13-05h08m-1723105062492-1723109100075``. That parent directory contains 1 zip file for each batch, named based on the batch number and the start and end timestamps of the messages in that batch, e.g, ``batch001-1723105062492-1723106622163.zip``. Each zip file contains the same information available in previous Mattermost server releases.

   Working from the same example above, the directory would look like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      administration-guide/comply/compliance-export-2024-08-13-05h08m-1723105062492-1723109100075

      ├── batch002-1723106622163-1723108196005.zip
      └── batch003-1723108196005-1723109100075.zip

   And each batch would look like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      batch001-1723105062492-1723106622163.zip
      ├── files
      ├── metadata.json
      └── actiance_export.xml

   Updated CSV export fields
   --------------------------

   **Post Creation Time** is always the ``CreateAt`` for messages and attachments, or ``JoinTime`` and ``LeaveTime`` for participant join and leave events, respectively.

   - **Update Time** indicates that the message has been updated, and this is the ``updateAt`` time.
   - **Updated Type** helps differentiate what kind of update it was as one of the following:

     - **EditedNewMsg** indicates that the message has been edited, and this is the new message (post-edit) content.
     - **EditedOriginalMsg** indicates that the message has been edited, and this the original message (pre-edit) content. This message will have another field ``EditedNewMsgId``, which is the Id of the message which holds the post-edited message contents.
     - **UpdatedNoMsgChange** indicates that message's content hasn't changed, but the post was updated for some reason, such as reaction, replied-to, a reply was edited, or a reply was deleted.
     - **Deleted** indicates that this message was deleted.
     - **FileDeleted** indicates that this message is recording that a file was deleted.

.. tab:: Prior to Mattermost v10.5

   The daily compliance export job creates a ``.zip`` file with a unique job identifier of all messages posted in the last 24 hours. You can unzip the file to easily transform the default ``.csv`` format into a desired format for your third-party archive system.

Actiance XML 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Actiance XML is the supported format for the 'Smarsh Vantage product <https://central.smarsh.com/s/product/vantage>`_.

1. Go to **System Console > Compliance > Compliance Export**.
2. Set **Enable Compliance Exports** to **true**.  
3. Set the **Compliance Export time**. This is the start time of the daily scheduled compliance export job and must be a 24-hour time stamp in the form HH:MM. Choose a time when fewer people are using your system.
4. Set the export file format to **Actiance XML**.
5. Select **Save**.

.. note::

   In Actiance XML exports, channel type is prepended to the channel names.

   Updated Actiance XML export fields
   ----------------------------------

   If an XML field is empty, it won't be exported. This is a change from previous Mattermost releases, where empty XML nodes were exported.

   - ``MessageId`` is the unique ``messageId``.
   - ``DateTimeUTC`` is always the post's ``CreateAt`` time.
   - ``UpdatedDateTimeUTC`` indicates that the message has been updated, and this is the ``updateAt`` time.
   - ``UpdatedType`` helps differentiate what kind of update it was, including:

     - ``EditedNewMsg`` indicates that this message has been edited, and this is the new message (post-edit) content.
     - ``EditedOriginalMsg`` indicates that this message has been edited, and this the original message (pre-edit) content. This message will have another field ``EditedNewMsgId``, which is the Id of the message which holds the post-edited message contents.
     - ``UpdatedNoMsgChange`` indicates that this message's content hasn't changed, but the post was updated for some reason, such as a reaction, replied-to, a reply was edited, or a reply was deleted.
     - ``Deleted`` indicates that the message was deleted.
     - ``FileDeleted`` indicates that the message is recording that a file was deleted.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

Are Playbooks and Boards data included in compliance exports?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Compliance exports only include channel messages, direct messages, file uploads, and posts from plugins/bots/webhooks. Data from Mattermost Playbooks (including run activities, status updates, and retrospectives) and Mattermost Boards (including cards, comments, and board activities) are not included in the compliance export functionality. Organizations requiring compliance archiving of Playbooks and Boards data should consider separate data retention strategies for these features.

How do I export past history?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the ``export`` :doc:`command line tool <../manage/command-line-tools>`. You can specify an ``exportFrom`` option to export data from a specified timestamp. All posts that were made after this timestamp will be exported.

How do I download compliance export jobs using mmctl?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Mattermost Server v10.11, system administrators can download compliance export jobs using the :ref:`mmctl compliance_export download <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl compliance-export download>` command. This provides a command-line interface for retrieving completed compliance export jobs by job ID.

What happens if I export data manually?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the compliance export job is run automatically, manually via the System Console, or manually via the CLI (without the ``--exportFrom`` option), it exports all posts that were made since the last post that the previous execution of the job exported. If this is the first time that the job has ever run, all posts that were made since the feature was enabled will be exported.

If the ``--exportFrom`` option is specified with the CLI command, all posts that have been made since the supplied timestamp will be exported.

When run manually via the System Console, ``.csv`` and Actiance XML files are written to the ``exports`` subdirectory of the configured :ref:`Local Storage Directory <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:local storage directory>`.  Files will be written to a folder with names based on an epoch time range. Global Relay EML export format files will be mailed to the configured email address when run manually.

Is there a maximum row limit for CSV files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. There's no limit to the number of rows within Compliance Monitoring CSV files.

How do I know if a compliance export job fails?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mattermost provides the status of each compliance export job in **System Console > Compliance > Compliance Export**. Here, you can see if the job succeeded or failed, including the number of messages and files exported.

In addition, any failures are returned in the server logs for self-hosted deployments. The error log begins with the string ``Failed job`` and includes a ``job_id key/value`` pair. Compliance export job failures are identified with worker name ``MessageExportWorker``. You can optionally create a script that programmatically queries for such failures and notifies the appropriate system.

.. note::
  
   This compliance export feature replaces legacy Compliance Reporting Oversight functionality. We recommend Enterprise customers migrate to the new system. For a sample CSV output of the new compliance export system, `download a CSV export file here <https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/source/samples/csv_export.zip>`__.
