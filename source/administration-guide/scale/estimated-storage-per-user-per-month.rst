File usage per user varies significantly across industries. The below benchmarks are recommended:

- **Low usage teams** (1-5 MB/user/month)

 - Primarily using text messages and links to communicate. Examples would include software development teams that heavily use web-based document creation and management tools, and therefore rarely upload files to the server.

- **Medium usage teams** (5-25 MB/user/month)

 - Using a mix of text messages as well as shared documents and images to communicate. Examples might include business teams that may commonly drag and drop screenshots, PDFs and Microsoft Office documents into Mattermost for sharing and review.

- **High usage teams** (25-100 MB/user/month)

 - Heaviest utilization comes from teams uploading a high number of large files into Mattermost on a regular basis. Examples include creative teams who share and store artwork and media with tags and commentary in a pipeline production process.
