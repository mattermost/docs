Mattermost provides the following performance monitoring statistics to integrate with Prometheus and Grafana.

Custom Mattermost metrics
-------------------------

The following is a list of custom Mattermost metrics that can be used to monitor your system's performance:

API metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``mattermost_api_time``: The total time in seconds to execute a given API handler.

Caching metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``mattermost_cache_etag_hit_total``: The total number of ETag cache hits for a specific cache.
- ``mattermost_cache_etag_miss_total``: The total number of ETag cache misses for an API call.
- ``mattermost_cache_mem_hit_total``: The total number of memory cache hits for a specific cache.
- ``mattermost_cache_mem_invalidation_total``: The total number of memory cache invalidations for a specific cache.
- ``mattermost_cache_mem_miss_total``: The total number of cache misses for a specific cache.

The above metrics can be used to calculate ETag and memory cache hit rates over time.

   :alt: Example debugging metrics, including number of messages per second, in a self-hosted Mattermost deployment.

Debugging metrics - jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``mattermost_jobs_active``: Number of active jobs.

Use ``mattermost_jobs_active`` to display an active jobs chart.

.. image:: ../../images/mattermost_active_jobs_chart.png
   :alt: Example debugging metrics, including active jobs, in a self-hosted Mattermost deployment.

Or, use ``mattermost_jobs_active`` to dynamically add a range annotation corresponding to jobs being active.

.. image:: ../../images/mattermost_dynamic_range_annotation.png
   :alt: Example debugging metrics, including number of messages per second, in a self-hosted Mattermost deployment.

Use annotations to streamline analysis when a job is long running, such as an LDAP synchronization job.

.. note::
  Jobs where the runtime is less than the Prometheus polling interval are unlikely to be visible because Grafana is performing range queries over the raw Prometheus timeseries data, and rendering an event each time the value changes.

Standard Go metrics
--------------------

.. include:: ../../_static/badges/all-commercial.rst
  :start-after: :nosearch:

The performance monitoring feature provides standard Go metrics for HTTP server runtime profiling data and system monitoring, such as:

- ``go_memstats_alloc_bytes`` for memory usage
- ``go_goroutines`` for number of goroutines
- ``go_gc_duration_seconds`` for garbage collection duration
- ``go_memstats_heap_objects`` for object tracking on the heap

To learn how to set up runtime profiling, see the `pprof package Go documentation <https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof>`__. You can also visit the ``ip:port`` page for a complete list of metrics with descriptions.

.. note::
   A Mattermost Enterprise license is required to connect to ``/metrics`` using HTTP.

If enabled, you can run the profiler by

``go tool pprof http://localhost:<port>/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=<duration>``

where you can replace ``localhost`` with the server name. The profiling reports are available at ``<ip>:<port>``, which include:

- ``/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30`` for CPU profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/cmdline`` for command line profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/symbol`` for symbol profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/trace`` for trace profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/goroutine`` for Go routine profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/heap`` for heap profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/threadcreate`` for threads profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/block`` for block profiling
- ``/debug/pprof/allocs`` for past memory allocations
- ``/debug/pprof/mutex`` for logs of the holders of contended mutexes

Host/system metrics
--------------------

From Metrics Plugin v0.7.0, you can pull metrics from `node exporter <https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter>`_ targets to access network-related panels for Mattermost Calls.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Why are chart labels difficult to distinguish?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chart labels used in server filters and legends are based on the hostname of your machines. If the hostnames are similar, then it will be difficult to distinguish the labels.

You can either set more descriptive hostnames for your machines or change the display name with a ``relabel_config`` in  `Prometheus configuration <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config>`__.
