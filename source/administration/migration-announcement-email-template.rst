To: End users

Subject: Moving to Mattermost


Hi all,

As some of you already know, we are moving from **[System]** to Mattermost as our communication platform. We have imported our existing users and data into Mattermost so we can continue to communicate, share files and collaborate.
 
To get started:

1. Open a browser on your computer, go to **[Mattermost URL]** and select “I forgot my password” to set your new password for Mattermost using the email address you used on the previous system.  

2. Once you reset your password, use your email and new password to log in. 

3. `Download <https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`__ the Mattermost apps for desktop and mobile. Refer to the `Mattermost Welcome Guide <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/welcome-to-mattermost.html>`__ on how to get up and running quickly.

4. Remember to bookmark the URL so you can use it to log in next time and start messaging!

Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to post in the **[~Mattermost channel]** or email us at **[Support email]**.

Happy messaging!
