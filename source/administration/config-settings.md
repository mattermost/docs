# Configuration Settings
Configuration settings can be modified by system administrators from the system console or directly in the config.json file.

## System Console Settings

The System Console user interface lets system administrators manage a Mattermost server and multiple teams from a web-based user interface. The first user added to a new Mattermost install is assigned the system administrator role and can access the System Console from the main menu of any team. 

Setting changes in the System Console are stored in `config/config.json`. 

Note: For any setting not explicitly set in `config.json` the Mattermost server will use the default value as documented here, and which can be observed in the default `config/config.json` file included in each Mattermost release. 

### Service Settings

General settings to configure the listening address, login security, testing, webhooks and service integration of Mattermost. 

#### System

**Listen Address** (`"ListenAddress": ":8065"`)  

The IP address on which to listen and the port on which to bind. Entering ":8065" will bind to all interfaces or you can choose one like `127.0.0.1:8065`. Changing this will require a server restart before taking effect.

**Maximum Login Attempts** (`"MaximumLoginAttempts": 10`)  

Failed login attempts allowed before a user is locked out and required to reset their password via email.

**Segment Developer Key** (`"SegmentDeveloperKey": ""`)  

For deployments seeking additional tracking of system behavior using Segment.com, you can enter a Segment WRITE_KEY using this field. This value works like a tracking code and is used in client-side Javascript and will send events to Segment.com attributed to the account you used to generate the WRITE_KEY.

**Google Developer Key** (`"GoogleDeveloperKey": ""`)  

Mattermost offers the ability to embed YouTube videos from URLs shared by end users. If Google detects the number of views is exceedingly high, they may throttle embed access. Should this occur, you can remove the throttle by registering for a Google Developer Key and entering it in this field following these instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im69kzhpR3I. Your Google Developer Key is used in client-side Javascript.

Using a Google Developer Key allows Mattermost to detect when a video is no longer available and display the post with a *Video not found* label.

**Enable Testing** (`"EnableTesting": false`)  

`true`: `/loadtest` slash command is enabled to load test accounts and test data.

**Enable Developer Mode** (`"EnableDeveloper": false`)  

`true`: Users are alerted to any console errors that occur.

`true`: Outgoing HTTPS requests can accept unverified, self-signed certificates. For example, outgoing webhooks to a server with a self-signed TLS certificate, using any domain, will be allowed; `false`: Only secure HTTPS requests are allowed.

Security note: Enabling this feature makes these connections susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Enable Multi-factor Authentication** (`"EnableSecurityFixAlert": true`) (Enterprise) 

`true`: When true, users will be given the option to require a phone-based passcode, in addition to their password-based authentication, to sign-in to the Mattermost server. Specifically, they will be asked to download the [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) app to their iOS or Android mobile device, connect the app with their account, and then enter a passcode generated by the app on their phone whenever they log in to the Mattermost server. 

**Allow Cross-origin Requests** (`"AllowCorsFrom": ""`)  

Enable HTTP cross-origin requests from specific domains separated by spaces. Type `*` to allow CORS from any domain or leave it blank to disable it.

**Session Length for Web in days** (`"SessionLengthWebInDays" : 30`)  

Set the number of days before web sessions expire and users will need to log in again.

**Session Length for Mobile in days** (`"SessionLengthMobileInDays" : 30`)  

Set the number of days before native mobile sessions expire.

**Session Length for SSO in days** (`"SessionLengthSSOInDays" : 30`)

This filter uses the permissions of the **Bind Username** account to execute the search. Administrators should make sure to use a specially created account for Bind Username with read-only access to the portion of the LDAP tree specified in the **Base DN** field. 

**First Name Attribute** (`"FirstNameAttribute": ""`)  

The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used to populate the first name of users in Mattermost.

**Last Name Attribute** (`"LastNameAttribute": ""`)  

The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used to populate the last name of users in Mattermost.

**Nickname Attribute** (`"NicknameAttribute": ""`)  

(Optional) The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used to populate the nickname of users in Mattermost.

**Email Attribute** (`"EmailAttribute": ""`)  

The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used to populate the email addresses of users in Mattermost. 

Email notifications will be sent to this email address, and this email address may be viewable by other Mattermost users depending on privacy settings choosen by the System Administrator. 

**Username Attribute** (`"UsernameAttribute": ""`)  

**The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used to populate the username field in Mattermost user interface.** This attribute will be used within the Mattermost user interface to identify and mention users. For example, if a Username Attribute is set to **john.smith** a user typing `@john` will see `@john.smith` in their auto-complete options and posting a message with `@john.smith` will send a notification to that user that they've been mentioned. 

The **Username Attribute** may be set to the same value used to sign-in to the system, called an **ID Attribute**, or it can be mapped to a different value. 

**ID Attribute** (`"IdAttribute": ""`)  

The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used as a unique identifier in Mattermost. It serves two purposes: 

**This value is used to sign in to Mattermost in the “LDAP Username” field on the sign in page.** This attribute can be the same as the **Username Attribute** field above, which is what is used to identify users in the Mattermost interface, or it can be a different value, for example a User ID number. If your team typically uses `DOMAIN\username` to sign in to other services with LDAP, you may enter a field name that maps to `DOMAIN\username` to maintain consistency between sites.

**This is the attribute that will be used to create unique Mattermost accounts.** This attribute should be an LDAP attribute with a value that does not change, such as `username` or `uid`. If a user’s **ID Attribute** changes and the user attempts to login the Mattermost server will attempt to create a new Mattermost user account based on the new **ID Attribute** and fail since new Mattermost users accounts can't be created with duplicate email addresses or Mattermost usernames (as defined in the **Username Attribute**).  

**Skip Certificate Verification** (`"SkipCertificateVerification": false`)  

(Optional) The attribute in the LDAP server that will be used to populate the nickname of users in Mattermost.

`true`: Skips the certificate verification step for TLS or STARTTLS connections. Not recommended for production environments where TLS is required. For testing only.

**Query Timeout (seconds)** (`"QueryTimeout": 60`)  

The timeout value for queries to the LDAP server. Increase this value if you are getting timeout errors caused by a slow LDAP server.

**Login Field Name** (`"LoginFieldName": ""`) 

The placeholder text that appears in the login field on the login page. Typically this would be whatever name is used to refer to LDAP credentials in your company, so it is recognizable to your users. Defaults to "LDAP Username". 

### Compliance Settings (Enterprise)  

Settings used to enable and configure Mattermost compliance reports. 

**Enable Compliance** (`"Enable": false`)
`true`: Compliance reporting is enabled in Mattermost; `false`: Compliance reporting is disabled. 

**Compliance Directory Location** (`"Directory": "./data/"`)
Sets the directory where compliance reports are stored. Defaults to "./data/". 

**Compliance Directory Location** (`"EnableDaily": false`)
`true`: Mattermost generates a daily compliance report; `false`: Daily reports are not generated. 

## Config.json settings not in System Console

System Console allows an IT Admin to update settings defined in `config.json`. However there are a number of settings in `config.json` unavailable in the System Console and require update from the file itself. We describe them here: 

### Service Settings

**Enable OAuth Service Provider** (`"EnableOAuthServiceProvider": false`)  

`true`: Allow Mattermost to function as an OAuth provider, allowing 3rd party apps access to your user store for authentication.

**WebSocket Secure Port** (`"WebsocketSecurePort" : 443`)  

When present in `config.json`, this setting defines the port on which the secured WebSocket will listen using the `wss` protocol. Otherwise it defaults to `443`. When the client attempts to make a WebSocket connection it first checks to see if the page is loaded with HTTPS. If so, it will use the secure WebSocket connection. If not, it will use the unsecure WebSocket connection. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS ONLY OPERATE UNDER HTTPS AND WSS. 

**WebSocket Port** (`WebsocketPort": 80`)  

When present in `config.json`, this setting defines the port on which the unsecured WebSocket will listen using the `ws` protocol. Otherwise it defaults to `80`. When the client attempts to make a WebSocket connection it first checks to see if the page is loaded with HTTPS. If so, it will use the secure WebSocket connection. If not, it will use the unsecure WebSocket connection. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS ONLY OPERATE UNDER HTTPS AND WSS. 

### File Settings

**Initial Font** (`"InitialFont": "luximbi.ttf"`)  

Font used in auto-generated profile pics with colored backgrounds.

**Amazon S3 Endpoint** (`"AmazonS3Endpoint": ""`)  

Set an endpoint URL for an Amazon S3 instance.

**Amazon S3 Bucket Endpoint** (`"AmazonS3BucketEndpoint": ""`)  

Set an endpoint URL for Amazon S3 buckets.

**Amazon S3 Location Constraint** (`"AmazonS3LocationConstraint": false`)  

Set whether the S3 region is location constrained.

**Amazon S3 Lowercase Bucket** (`"AmazonS3LowercaseBucket": false`)    

Set whether bucket names are fully lowercase or not.

### GitLab Settings

**Scope** (`"Scope": ""`)  

Standard setting for OAuth to determine the scope of information shared with OAuth client. Not currently supported by GitLab OAuth.
