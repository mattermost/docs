Mattermost Incident Management is the first workflow that we officially support as part of DevOps Command Center. 

Better response to an incident is one of three ways that Mattermost Incident Management helps you provide more reliable services, in addition to gaining insights with incident reports and incorporating learnings with playbooks.

The Mattermost Incident Management documentation can be found `here <https://mattermost.gitbook.io/mattermost-incident-management>`_.
