Release Definitions
===================

Mattermost ships with a new version on the 16th of each month in `binary form <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html>`_.

For the past few years, Mattermost used a monthly “tick-tock” alternating release cycle. A tick-tock cycle refers to even-numbered releases (e.g., 5.26) containing new features, and odd-numbered releases (e.g., 5.27) containing only bug fixes and performance improvements. As our product and team continue to evolve, we're moving away from this alternating release cycle in favor of a general monthly release.

Feature Release
----------------

The Feature Releases have new features added. These are even-numbered releases (e.g., 5.24).

Quality Release
----------------

The Quality Releases contain only bug fixes and performance improvements and are more stable than Feature Releases. These are odd-numbered releases (e.g., 5.25). It is highly recommended to upgrade to a Quality Release if your organization prefers stability over having the newest features and improvements.

Extended Support Release (ESR)
------------------------------

Extended Support Releases are releases that are maintained for a longer period of time. They will receive backports for security fixes and major bug fixes for the length of their life cycle.
