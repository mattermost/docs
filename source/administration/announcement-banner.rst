By default, users can dismiss the banner until they log in again or until you update the banner. You can update the banner by either changing the text of the banner or by re-enabling the banner after it has been disabled. You can also control the text color and the background color. A setting in the System Console allows you to prevent users from dismissing the banner.

**To enable the banner**

1. Go to **System Console > Site Configuration**, then select **Announcement Banner**.
2. For **Enable Announcement Banner**, select **true**.
3. In the **Banner Text** field, enter the text of the announcement that you want to make.
4. Set the background and text colors.
5. To prevent users from dismissing the banner, select **false** for **Allow Banner Dismissal**.
6. Select **Save**.
