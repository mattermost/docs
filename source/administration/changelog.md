## Release v5.20 - [Feature Release](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/release-faq.html#release-overview)

- **v5.20.2, release day TBD**
  - Investigating an issue where switching to an unread channel sometimes gets stuck at "Loading...". [MM-22698](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22698)
- **v5.20.1, released 2020-02-16**
  - Fixed an issue where upgrading to v5.20 failed on servers running with ``PluginSettings.Enable = false``, and ``LogSettings.EnableDiagnostics = true``.
- **v5.20.0, released 2020-02-16**
  - Original 5.20.0 release

Mattermost v5.20.0 contains a low level security fix. [Upgrading](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
 - Any [pre-packaged plugin](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#pre-packaged-plugins) that is not enabled in the ``config.json`` will no longer install automatically, but can continue to be installed via the [plugin marketplace](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-marketplace).
 - Boolean elements from interactive dialogs are no longer serialized as strings. While we try to avoid breaking changes, this change was necessary to allow both the web and mobile apps to work with the boolean elements introduced with v5.16.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.19, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### A Banner to Jump to the Most Recent Posts
 - Ability to jump to the most recent posts in a channel by clicking a banner that automatically appears in busy channels with unread messages.
 
#### Open Email Notifications in the Desktop or Mobile App
 - Ability to open messages from email notifications in the Mattermost desktop or mobile apps instead of being directed to open them in the browser.
 
#### Ship MMCTL with Mattermost
 - Manage servers remotely with `mmctl`, a CLI tool that mimics the Mattermost CLI tool and ships inside Mattermost.

#### Reworked pre-packaged plugins
 - Pre-packaged plugins are now “pre-downloaded” plugins that are available within the Plugin Marketplace, even if your server doesn’t have direct access to the internet.
 
#### Plugin Marketplace Labels
 - Plugins supported by Mattermost and community supported plugins will be visible, making it easier to select an appropriate plugin based on your organization’s security policies.
  
#### Role mapping from LDAP and SAML (E20)
 - Ability to assign and restrict users to roles within Mattermost from your single sign-on (SSO) system.
 
#### Faster SAML install and configuration (E20)
 - Ability to use SAML without installing a separate binary and pull configuration metadata directly from the Identity Provider using an account-specific URL.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added support for mute option in Direct Message channel menus.
 - Added a red dot to browser favicon when there are unread mentions.

#### Plugins

 - Added support for plugins to add menu items to the Channel Menu.
 
#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Added a CLI command ``webhook move`` for moving outgoing webhooks.
 
#### Bulk Import
 - When bulk import finds an already existing post, it now deletes existing files before importing new ones.

#### Administration

  - Mattermost v5.18.1 contains a high level security fix. [Upgrading](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).
  - Fixed an issue where migrating accounts from email to SAML failed. [MM-21472](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21472)
- **v5.18.0, released 2019-12-16**
  - Original 5.18.0 release

### Compatibility
 
### Important Upgrade Notes
- Marking a post unread from the mobile app requires v1.26 or later. If using v5.18, but mobile is on v1.25 or earlier, marking a post unread from webapp/desktop will only be reflected on mobile the next time the app launches or is brought to the foreground.

### Breaking Changes
 - The Go module path of ``mattermost-server`` was changed to comply with the Go module version specification. Developers using Go modules with ``mattermost-server`` as a dependency must change the module and import paths to ``github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/v5`` when upgrade this dependency to `v5.18`. See https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules for further information.
 - Removed ``Team.InviteId`` from the related Websocket event and sanitized it on all team API endpoints for users without invite permissions.
 - Removed the ability to change the type of a channel using the ``PUT /channels/{channel_id}`` API endpoint. The new ``PUT /channels/{channel_id}/privacy`` endpoint should be used for that purpose.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.17, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights
 
#### ID Loaded push notifications (E20)
 - Allows push notifications to be delivered showing the full message contents that are fetched from the server once the notification is delivered to the device. This means that Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) or Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) cannot read the message contents since only a unique message ID is sent in the notification payload. 
 
#### Allow Plugin Upgrades
 - Added ability to upgrade plugins and prepackaged plugins via the marketplace.
 
#### Mark Posts as Unread
 - When marking a post as unread, the user will land on the unread post the next time they click on the relevant channel.
 
#### mmctl remote CLI tool
 - Allows a system admin to run commands when conventional access to the server via SSH isn't possible.

#### View Archived Channels (Beta)
 - View, share and search for content of archived channels. See more details [here](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#allow-users-to-view-archived-channels-beta).

#### Guest Account SAML & LDAP Support (EE)
 - Provision Guests directly from AD/LDAP or SAML upon login. Guests will have no access to any teams or channels until they are assigned.

#### Actiance Improvements (E20)
 - Added events (such as post/file deletion and edit events) to Actiance Export to improve tracking within the Vantage report interface.

#### LDAP Group Sync upgraded to Beta phase (E20)
 - Previously in “Experimental” phase, the linking of AD/LDAP groups to Mattermost groups is now officially in “Beta” phase.

### Improvements

 - Added the ability to add users as another user to the plugin API.
 - Restricted user access to ``/logs`` API endpoint.

### Compatibility

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

 - Support for Internet Explorer (IE11) was removed. Learn more in our [forum post](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/mattermost-is-dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-ie11-in-v5-16/7575).
 
### Breaking Changes
 - The Mattermost Desktop v4.3.0 release includes a change to how desktop notifications are sent from non-secure URLs (http://). Organizations using non-secure Mattermost Servers (http://) will need to update to Mattermost Server versions 5.16.0+, 5.15.1, 5.14.4 or 5.9.5 (ESR) to continue receiving desktop notifications when using Mattermost Desktop v4.3.0 or later.
 - When enabling [Guest Accounts](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/guest-accounts.html), all users who have the ability to invite users will be able to invite guests by default.  System admins will need to remove this permission on each role via **System Console > Permissions Schemes**.  In Mattermost Server version 5.17, the System admin will be the only role to automatically get the invite guest permission, however the fix will not be applicable in 5.16 due to database migration processes.

### Highlights

#### Guest Accounts
 - Provides a controlled and secure method for users outside of an organization to collaborate with their organization without allowing the guest to access proprietary or confidential information.

#### Plugin Marketplace
 - The integrations marketplace is built into the product and gives system administrators the ability to discover and install Mattermost plugins that are compatible with the server version you are running.  

#### Improved user management 
 - System Administrators can view a user's team memberships and add a user to additional teams from the System Console without having to be a member of the team.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added support for showing TIF image thumbnail previews.
 - Added the ability to remove the custom branding image.
 - Added support for showing channel links as links in email notifications.
 - Added support for direct message permalinks.
 - Changed recent date separators to read Today/Yesterday.

#### Import/Export
 - Added support for including the Theme property on ``UserTeamMemberships`` in bulk exports.

#### Search
 - Added support for excluding results from search.
 
#### Notifications
 - Enabled account related emails when ``SendEmailNotifications`` is set to false.
 
#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Added a ``integrity`` CLI command to verify database integrity.
 
#### Plugins
 - Added the ability for plugins to render custom embed views for posts.
 - Added support for including custom System Console components for plugins.
 - Added support for plugins to close the right-hand sidebar.
 
#### Integrations
 - Added support for introductory markdown paragraph in interactive dialogs.
 - Added a password type for interactive dialogs.
 - Added support for footer and footer_icon in attachments.
 - Added support for boolean elements in interactive dialogs.
 - Added support for a ``radio`` type in interactive dialogs.
 
#### Performance
 - Improved perceived performance of the emoji picker.
 - Improved post list performance by making thread comments be loaded only when needed.
 - Improved quick switcher experience to make the autocomplete feel more like a modal rather than a dropdown.

#### Administration
 - Added the ability for System Administrators to revoke all sessions from all users.
 - Added support for System Administrators to make public channels private and private channels public within the **System Console > User Management > Channel Configuration** page when [Experimental Groups feature](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#groups-experimental) is enabled.
 - Added user Id information in the **System Console > Users** page.
 - Updated System Console plugin settings page to expose enable/disable setting.
 - Added ability for System Administrators to view a user's team memberships and add users to additional teams within **System Console > User Management > User Configuration**.

### Compatibility

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

 - We are removing support for Internet Explorer (IE11) in Mattermost v5.16.0, which releases on October 16, 2019. Learn more in our [forum post](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/mattermost-is-dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-ie11-in-v5-16/7575).
 
### Breaking Changes

 - Webhooks are now only displayed if the user is the creator of the webhook or a system administrator.
 - With the update from Google+ to Google People, system admins need to ensure the ``GoogleSettings.Scope`` config.json setting is set to ``profile email`` and ``UserAPIEndpoint`` setting should be set to ``https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/me?personFields=names,emailAddresses,nicknames,metadata`` per [updated documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/sso-google.html).

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.13, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Keyboard navigation and screen reader improvements

 - New keyboard navigation improvements enable you to move between app regions—like the post list, channel sidebar, and header—using F6 on the Desktop App and CTRL-F6 on a web browser. You can also use TAB, arrow keys, and ENTER to interact with buttons, links, and other elements in Mattermost.
 - Screen readers are now much more compatible with Mattermost. Buttons, links, and app regions now have accurate readouts that enable visually impaired users to use Mattermost productively with screen readers.
 - [Learn more](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/accessibility.html)

#### Bidirectional scrolling to land on oldest unread post
 - No more scrolling required to get to the oldest unread post. Now when the channel opens when there are unreads it opens at the new messages line, regardless of how many unreads exist since the last time the user viewed the channel.

#### Jira V2.1
 - Full list of features in v2.1: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira#jira-21-features.

#### System Console tools to manage LDAP Groups within Teams and Channels (EE)
 - New Team and Channel pages in the System Console allow administrators to easily manage teams and channels membership with LDAP Group Synchronization instead of using the CLI group commands released in v5.12.
 
#### Pre-packaged Plugins
 - [Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jenkins) for interacting with jobs and builds via slash commands in Mattermost.
 - [Antivirus plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-antivirus) for scanning files uploaded to Mattermost.
 - [GitLab plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab) for getting notifications in Mattermost about mentions, review requests and comments.

### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:

 - Under ``ElasticsearchSettings`` in ``config.json``:
    - Added ``SkipTLSVerification`` to ignore certificate verification for Elasticsearch.
 
#### Open Source Components

 - Added ``moment-timezone`` in https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux/.

#### Database Changes

 - ``plugins`` type entries in the ``Jobs`` table will be purged on upgrade. This job was incorrectly configured to run every minute, spamming the table with mostly useless records. All old records will be removed on upgrade, and the job will run daily instead.

### Known Issues
 - Cannot leave any team when a default [primary team](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#primary-team-experimental) is set.

 - Google login fails on the Classic mobile apps.
 - Status may sometimes get stuck as away or offline in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.

 - Team sidebar on desktop app does not update when channels have been read on mobile.
 - Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
 - Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.

### Breaking changes since last release

 - If your plugin uses the ``DeleteEphemeralMessage`` plugin API, update it to accept a ``postId string`` parameter. See [documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/server/reference/#API.DeleteEphemeralPost) to learn more.
 - Image link and YouTube previews do not display unless **System Console > Enable Link Previews** is enabled. Please ensure that your Mattermost server is connected to the internet and has network access to the websites from which previews are expected to appear. [Learn more here](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-link-previews).
 - ``ExperimentalEnablePostMetadata`` setting was removed. Post metadata, including post dimensions, is now stored in the database to correct scroll position and eliminate scroll jumps as content loads in a channel.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.11, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Highlights

#### Infinite Scroll
 - Read messages more easily. Older posts are loaded automatically as you scroll up instead of having to click the "Load more messages" button at the top of the screen. This feature is not supported on Internet Explorer (IE11).
 
#### Bot Accounts
 - Users no longer have to rely on creating fake user accounts to act as bots for integrations. Instead, create a real bot account and use it to generate bot access tokens to interact with users and complete tasks.
 - Users can can also use these bots to post to any channel in the system, whether it’s a private team, private channel or a direct message channel.
 - For Enterprise deployments, bot accounts no longer count as an active user towards licensing subscriptions.
 - To learn more about bot accounts, see [the documentation](https://mattermost.com/pl/default-bot-accounts).
 
#### Jira Plugin 2.0
 - Enhanced existing plugin for a deep two-way integration between Jira and Mattermost.
 - Send notifications for Jira issue creation, issue updates and comments to Mattermost channels.
 - Users can also take quick actions in Mattermost, including creating Jira issues, attaching Mattermost messages to Jira issues, and transitioning issues via slash commands.
 - For a full feature set for 2.0, see https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira#jira-20-features.
 
#### Pre-packaged Plugins
 - New pre-packaged plugins bundled with this Mattermost release include:
   - [GitHub plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-github) for notifications, reminders and slash commands to stay up-to-date on issues and pull requests. Supports GitHub SaaS and Enterprise versions.
   - [Autolink plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink) to automatically hyperlink text, such as adding links to your issue tracker when someone posts an issue key or number.
   - [Custom Attributes plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes) to add custom attributes in the user profile popover.
   - [Welcome Bot plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-welcomebot) to improve onboarding and HR processes by adding a Welcome Bot that helps add new team members to channels.
   - [Amazon SNS CloudWatch plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-aws-sns) to send alert notifications from [Amazon AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to Mattermost channels via AWS SNS.

#### System Console Reorganization
 - Informational architecture restructure of the System Console to make a more logical flow to the settings and to provide a more cohesive experience for hiding features on the Mattermost Private Cloud product, where the system admin should not have access to change configurations that affect the environment directly.

#### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
 - We are gathering user feedback to help improve user experience and hear directly from our users. The feature can be disabled via **System Console > Plugins > Net Promoter Score**.
 
#### AD/LDAP Group Sync Removals (Enterprise Edition E20)
 - System Admins can manage the membership of private teams and channels with AD/LDAP groups, eliminating the need to individually add and remove members. Users in the groups are automatically removed from the team or channel when removed from an associated group.
 
#### User/Channel Search & Autocomplete in Elasticsearch (Enterprise Edition E20)
 - Added new settings in **System Console > Elasticsearch** to enable [Elasticsearch](https://about.mattermost.com/default-elasticsearch-documentation/) for autocompletion queries. When enabled, Elasticsearch uses its indexed data for user/channel search queries and autocomplete queries.

### Improvements

#### User Interface (UI)
 - Added an option to add a user to a channel from the profile popover.
 - Removed ``@`` for full name display in push notifications.
 
#### Plugins
 - Added support for Markdown in plugin System Console help text fields.
 - Added support for plugins to override ephemeral posts.

#### Localization
 - Promoted Polish language to "official".

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - Added a ``command modify`` CLI command to modify slash commands.
 - Added a ``mattermost user convert --bot`` CLI command to convert user accounts to bot accounts.
 - Implemented a new command ``config migrate`` for migrating configuration to and from the database.
 - For AD/LDAP Group Sync, added the following CLI commands:
   - ``group team enable`` to add the ability to switch a team to be group-constrained.
   - ``group team disable``to add the ability to disable group constraint on the specified team.
   - ``group team list`` to list the groups associated with a team.
   - ``group team status`` to show the group constraint status of the specified team.
   - ``group channel enable`` to add the ability to switch a channel to be group-constrained.
   - ``group channel disable`` to disable group constraint on the specified channel.
   - ``group channel list`` to list the groups associated with a channel.
   - ``group channel status`` to show the group constraint status of the specified channel.
 
#### Administration
 - Added support for running two Mattermost instances on the same domain using subpaths.
 - Added support for importing threads from Slack.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where releasing a mouse click while the cursor was outside of the Rename Channel modal would close the modal.

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:

 - Under ``"PluginSettings":`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``"EnableHealthCheck": true``, to ensure all plugins are periodically monitored, and restarted or deactivated based on their health status.
 - Under ``"NotificationLogSettings":`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``"EnableConsole": true``, ``"ConsoleLevel": "DEBUG"``, ``"ConsoleJson": true``, ``"EnableFile": true``, ``"FileLevel": "INFO"``, ``"FileJson": true``, and ``"FileLocation": ""``, to implement a structured logger to keep track of push notifications.
 - Under ``"ServiceSettings":`` in ``config.json``:
   - Added ``"EnableBotAccountCreation": false`` to enable bot account creation.
   - Added ``"DisableBotsWhenOwnerIsDeactivated": true`` to disable bots automatically when the owner is deactivated.

 - LDAP Group Sync:
    - Added API endpoints ``getGroupsByChannel`` and ``GetGroupsByTeam`` to retrieve groups by team and by channel.
    - Added ``group_constrained`` API to both ``/users`` and ``/users/search`` endpoints to be able to limit users listed to those allowed by group-constraints.
    - Added the ``GetGroups`` API endpoint to retrieve lists of groups with searching, pagination, and member counts.
 - Disabled Team InviteID modification via Create/Update actions and moved it to a dedicated API endpoint.
    
#### Plugin API v4 Changes
 - Added ``KVCompareAndSet(key string, old []byte, new []byte)`` to Plugin API to add support for transactional semantics with KV Store in plugin framework.

## Release v5.11 - Quality Release

Mattermost v5.11.0 contains low level security fixes. [Upgrading](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) is recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

- **v5.11.1, released 2019-06-20** 
  - Mattermost v5.11.1 contains a medium level security fix. [Upgrading](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) is highly recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) 30 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).
- **v5.11.0, released 2019-05-16**
  - Original 5.11.0 release

### Breaking changes since last release

 - If your integration uses ``Update.Props == nil`` to clear ``Props``, this will no longer work in 5.11+. Instead, use ``Update.Props == {}`` to clear properties. This change was made because ``Update.Props == nil`` unintentionally cleared all ``Props``, such as the profile picture, instead of preserving them.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from a release earlier than 5.10, please read the other [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue where **System Console** > **Users** bottom section of "user actions" menu was cut off for the last three users in the screen.
 - Fixed an issue where corners on image previews were squared instead of rounded.
 - Fixed an issue where the hover effect was missing on images.
 - Fixed an issue where a post action (via button or menu) reset the profile picture of the webhook post.
 - Fixed an issue where a flagged post containing only file attachments didn't render in the sidebar until loaded in the centre.
 - Fixed an issue where some strings in channel settings weren't localizable.
 - Fixed an issue where clicking "Open" downloaded an image instead of opening it.
 - Fixed an issue where an at-mention user autocomplete overlapped with the channel header when drafting a long message containing a file attachment.
 - Fixed an issue where the reply bar showed gaps between posts in compact view.
 - Fixed an issue where markdown preview of nested lists displayed differently from styling in posted message.
 - Fixed an issue where Safari suggested auto-corrections in the channel switcher.
 - Fixed an issue on Safari where the mention badge count didn't update immediately.
 - Fixed an issue where the post action menu overlapped with posts on iOS/Safari on mobile view.
 - Fixed an issue where interactive dialog's description text colour was difficult to see on dark themes.
 - Fixed an issue where delete permissions for custom emoji team admin role were not always granted.
 - Fixed an issue with a slight scroll pop on reaching loading indictor of search results.
 - Fixed an issue where adding a user to a channel that is in the unreads section caused the channel to become read in the user's view.
 - Fixed an issue where the channel menu dropdown icon had an unnecessary tooltip.
 - Fixed an issue on LDAP Groups where adding a group to a team provided an unnecessary permission confirmation modal.
 - Fixed an issue on mobile view where clicking on the attachment icon didn't bring up the dropdown menu.

### Known Issues
 - Buttons inside ephemeral posts are not clickable / functional on the mobile app.
 - On a server using a subpath, the URL opens a blank page if the system admin changes the Site URL in the System Console UI. The system admin should restart the server to fix it.

### Breaking Changes since last release

 - If **DisableLegacyMfa** setting in ``config.json`` is set to ``true`` and multi-factor authentication is enabled, ensure your users have upgraded to mobile app version 1.17 or later. Otherwise, users who have MFA enabled may not be able to log in successfully. See [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.
 - The public IP of the Mattermost application server is considered a reserved IP for additional security hardening in the context of untrusted external requests such as Open Graph metadata, webhooks or slash commands. See [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from another release than 5.8, please read the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

### Breaking Changes since the last release

 - Replaced WebRTC prototype with other video and audio calling solutions. [Learn more here](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/video-and-audio-calling.html).
 - Removed support for IE11 Mobile View due to low usage and instability in order to invest that effort in maintaining a high quality experience on other more used browsers. End users on IE11 will thus have an increased minimum screen size.
 - If EnablePublicChannelsMaterialization setting in config.json is set to false, an offline migration prior to upgrade may be required to synchronize the materialized table for public channels to increase channel search performance in the channel switcher (CTRL/CMD+K), channel autocomplete (~) and elsewhere in the UI. See [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.
 
**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from another release than 5.5, please read the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).

Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) 14 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).
 - **v5.0.2, released 2018-07-16**
   - Mattermost v5.0.2 contains a high severity security fix. [Upgrading](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) is highly recommended.

 - **v5.0.0, released 2018-06-16**

### Breaking Changes since the last release

- All API v3 endpoints have been removed. [See documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/schema) to learn more about how to migrate your integrations to API v4. [Ticket #8708](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-8708).
- `platform` binary has been renamed to mattermost for a clearer install and upgrade experience. **You should point your `systemd` service file at the new `mattermost` binary.** All command line tools, including the bulk loading tool and developer tools, have also been renamed from platform to mattermost. [Ticket #9985](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9985).
- A Mattermost user setting to configure desktop notification duration in **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Desktop Notifications** has been removed.

Although unlikely, this could break custom slash commands that use GET requests incorrectly. [Ticket #10201](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10201).
- A new `config.json` setting to whitelist types of protocols for auto-linking has been added. [Ticket #9547](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9547).

The setting is off by default for all new and existing installs, except those deployed on GitLab Omnibus. A System Administrator can enable the API v4 endpoint from the config.json file. [Ticket #9916](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9916).
- An unused `ExtraUpdateAt` field has been removed from the channel model. [Ticket #9739](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9739).

#### Upcoming Deprecated Features in Mattermost v5.0

The following deprecations are planned for the Mattermost v5.0 release, which is scheduled for summer/2018. This list is subject to change prior to the release.

1. All API v3 endpoints will be removed. [See documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/schema) to learn more about how to migrate your integrations to API v4. [Ticket #8708](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-8708).
2. `platform` binary will be renamed to mattermost for a clearer install and upgrade experience. All command line tools, including the bulk loading tool and developer tools, will also be renamed from platform to mattermost. [Ticket #9985](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9985).
3. A Mattermost user setting to configure desktop notification duration in **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Desktop Notifications** will be removed.
4. Slash commands configured to receive a GET request will have the payload being encoded in the query string instead of receiving it in the body of the request, consistent with standard HTTP requests. Although unlikely, this could break custom slash commands that use GET requests incorrectly. [Ticket #10201](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10201).
5. A new `config.json` setting to whitelist types of protocols for auto-linking will be added. [Ticket #9547](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9547).

The setting will be off by default for all new and existing installs, except those deployed on GitLab Omnibus. A System Administrator can enable the API v4 endpoint from the config.json file. [Ticket #9916](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9916).
7. An unused `ExtraUpdateAt` field will be removed from the channel model. [Ticket #9739](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-9739).

### Security Update

- Mattermost v4.7.0 contains multiple security fixes ranging from low to high severity. [Upgrading](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) is highly recommended. Details will be posted on our [security updates page](https://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) 14 days after release as per the [Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.mattermost.org/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

### Highlights

#### Client-Side Performance

 - Added user-based rate limiting, in addition to rate limiting API access by IP address.
 - Decreased page load time by loading custom emojis asynchronously rather than all on first page load.
 - Optimized channel autocomplete (~) query by returning client-side results immediately.
 - Decreased the size of most image assets by more than 25% by running `pngquant` to remove unnecessary metadata from PNGs.

#### Image Proxy Support

 - Image proxy servers increase performance through a layer of caching, and provide custom options to resize images.
 - Three new configuration keys, `ImageProxyType`, `ImageProxyURL`, `ImageProxyOptions`, ensure that posts served to the client will have their markdown modified such that all images are loaded through a proxy.

#### Updated Image Thumbnails

 - Updated the appearance of image thumbnails, so that single thumbnails will now expand to a larger preview without clicking the image to open the preview window.

#### Experimental Setting for Unreads Sidebar Section

 - Added an experimental setting to group unread channels in the channel sidebar. The setting [must first be enabled by the System Admin](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#group-unread-channels-experimental), by replacing `disabled` with either `default_off` or `default_on` in config.json.

### Improvements

#### Web User Interface
 - Added a status icon in the channel member list and sorted it by user status.
 - Added ability to preview images found in link previews.
 - Added a `Copy Link` option for sidebar channels in the Desktop App.
 - Added focus on the text box after hitting "Edit" on Account Settings options.
 - Improved formatting of quotes in the channel header.
 - Added a date separator for search results.
 - Channel names are now sorted correctly in the left-hand-side by taking non-alphabetical characters into consideration (e.g. brackets, hash sign, etc.)

 #### Integrations
 - Added username and profile picture to incoming webhook set up pages.
 - Added support for Slack attachments in outgoing webhook responses.

#### Emoji Picker
 - Added the ability to navigate emoji picker with the keyboard.
 - Added paging and search of custom emojis to webapp emoji picker.

#### Channels
 - Users are directed to the last channel they viewed in a team when switching to that team.
 - Changed URLs of Direct Messages to use the form of `https://servername.com/messages/@username`, letting users open a direct message with each other via URL.

#### Notifications
 - Added a system message when a team is changed from public to private.

#### Plugins (Beta)
 - Zoom plugin now supports on-premise Zoom servers.

#### Enterprise Edition
- Increased max length of `User.Position` field to 128 characters to meet LDAP max length.
- Increased OAuth state parameter limit. Some systems may send a state longer than 128 characters.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where OAuth account creation error page was unformatted.
 - Fixed tab and alt-tab keyboard navigation for links on sign-in page.
 - Fixed an issue where plugin slash commands didn't override username or icon.
 - Fixed an issue where pagination for team members modal showed a next button when there are no more users to show.
 - Fixed an issue where at-channel in `/header` should not trigger confirmation modal.
 - Fixed an issue where auto-generated SAML Service provider login URL had two slashes instead of one.
 - Fixed an issue where no unread mention appeared on non-mobile platform after receiving push notification.
 - Fixed an issue where the text box was hidden by the keyboard when replying to a post in mobile view.
 - Fixed username autocomplete not working with mixed cases.
 - Fixed not being able to type Korean quickly in some dialogs.
 - Fixed an issue where notification preference settings didn't respect case sensitivity for mention highlighting.
 - Fixed where, after an ephemeral message, couldn't use `+:emoji:` to react to the previous message.
 - Fixed Mattermost not loading on Firefox if the `media.peerconnection.enabled` setting in Firefox is set to false.

 - Fixed an issue where bot messages from the Zoom plugin ignored the Zoom API URL field for on-prem Zoom servers.
 - Disabled pull-to-refresh feature on Android (Chrome) to prevent unwanted page refresh.
 - Fixed an issue where clicking `Save` in `Rename Channel` modal without changes did nothing.
 - Fixed emoji picker search being case-sensitive.
 - Fixed timestamp not being clickable in desktop mobile view.
 - Fixed an issue where deleting a team via the API broke the web user interface.

### Compatibility

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

- All API v3 endpoints have been deprecated, and scheduled for removal in Mattermost v5.0.
- The `mentionKeys` prop in post type plugins is now removed to fix case sensitive mention highlighting. Plugins can retrieve the `mentionKeys` prop from the store as needed.
- The permanent query parameter of the DELETE `/teams/{team_id}` APIv4 endpoint is not removed as previously announced, given customer and community feedback.
- As Mattermost moves to a role based permissions system in v4.8, a number of configuration settings will be migrated to roles in the database, and changing their `config.json` values will no longer take effect. These permissions can still be modified by their respective System Console settings. The `config.json` settings to be migrated are:
  - RestrictPublicChannelManagement
  - RestrictPrivateChannelManagement
  - RestrictPublicChannelCreation
  - RestrictPrivateChannelCreation
  - RestrictPublicChannelDeletion
  - RestrictPrivateChannelDeletion
  - RestrictPrivateChannelManageMembers
  - EnableTeamCreation
  - EnableOnlyAdminIntegrations
  - RestrictPostDelete
  - AllowEditPost
  - RestrictTeamInvite

For a list of past and upcoming deprecated features, [see our website](https://about.mattermost.com/deprecated-features/).

#### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

#### Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition:

 - Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"ImageProxyType": ""`, `"ImageProxyOptions": ""`, and `"ImageProxyURL": ""` to ensure posts served to the client will have their markdown modified such that all images are loaded through a proxy.
    - Added `"ExperimentalGroupUnreadChannels": disabled` to show an unread channel section in the webapp sidebar. The setting must first be enabled by the System Admin, by replacing `disabled` with either `default_off` or `default_on`.
    - Added `"ExperimentalEnableDefaultChannelLeaveJoinMessages": true` that allows disabling of leave/join messages in the default channel, usually Town Square.
 - Under `RateLimitingSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"VaryByUser": false`, a user-based rate limiting, to rate limit on token and on userID.

### API Changes

 - It is required that any new integrations use API v4 endpoints. For more details, and for a complete list of available endpoints, see [https://api.mattermost.com/](https://api.mattermost.com/).
 - All API v3 endpoints have been deprecated, and scheduled for removal in Mattermost v5.0.

#### RESTful API v4 Changes

 - Added `GetChannelByName` and `GetTeamByName` to auto lowercase team and channel names in API requests. This ensures that the channel name is automatically lowercased for endpoints taking team or channel names as URL parameters.
 - Added `POST /emoji/search`, `GET /emojis/name/{emoji_name}`, and `GET /emoji/autocomplete` to add consistency with user search/autocomplete endpoints. These API endpoints ensure that the benefits of `GET` for important performance related actions such as autocompleting are included.
 - Added `/users/tokens/search` to allow System Admin to be able to find, manage and revoke personal access tokens as needed. This endpoint gets all tokens for all users if one has the `manage_system` permission.

### WebSocket Event Changes

 - Added `delete_team` web socket event to notify client whenever a team is deleted (e.g. via API call).

### Database Changes

**Users Table:**

 - Increased size of `Position` field from 35 to 128 characters.

**OAuthAuthData Table:**

 - Increased size of `State` field from 128 to 1024 characters.

**ChannelMemberHistory Table:**

- Jump link in search results does not always jump to display the expected post.
- Status may sometimes get stuck as away or offline in High Availability mode with IP Hash turned off.

- Channel scroll position flickers while images and link previews load.
- CTRL/CMD+U shortcut to upload a file doesn't work on Firefox.
- Numbered lists can sometimes extend beyond the normal post area.
- Slack import through the CLI fails if email notifications are enabled.
- Push notifications don't always clear on iOS when running Mattermost in High Availability mode.

### Compatibility

#### Breaking Changes

1 - Mattermost now handles multiple content types for integrations, including plaintext content type. If your integration suddenly prints the JSON payload data instead of rendering the generated message, make sure your integration is returning the `application/json` content-type to retain previous behavior.

2 - By default, user-supplied URLs such as those used for Open Graph metadata, webhooks, or slash commands will no longer be allowed to connect to reserved IP addresses including loopback or link-local addresses used for internal networks.

This change may cause private integrations to break in testing environments, which may point to a URL such as http://127.0.0.1:1021/my-command.

If you point private integrations to such URLs, you may whitelist such domains, IP addresses, or CIDR notations via the [AllowedUntrustedInternalConnections config setting](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#allow-untrusted-internal-connections-to) in your local environment. Although not recommended, you may also whitelist the addresses in your production environments. See [documentation to learn more](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#allow-untrusted-internal-connections-to).

Push notification, OAuth 2.0 and WebRTC server URLs are trusted and not affected by this setting.

3 - Uploaded file attachments are now grouped by day and stored in `/data/<date-of-upload-as-YYYYMMDD>/teams/...` of your file storage system.

4 - Mattermost `/platform` repo has been separated to `/mattermost-webapp` and `/mattermost-server`. This may affect you if you have a private fork of the `/platform` repo. [More details here](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/mattermost-separating-platform-into-two-repositories-on-september-6th/3708).

#### Removed and Deprecated Features

### Compatibility

#### Breaking Changes

- If you are using NGINX as a proxy for the Mattermost Server, replace the `location /api/v3/users/websocket {` line with `location ~ /api/v[0-9]+/(users/)?websocket$ {` in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost` NGINX configuration file. [See documentation to learn more](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/install-ubuntu-1404.html#configuring-nginx-as-a-proxy-for-mattermost-server).
- If you are upgrading a High Availability Cluster: When upgrading from 3.10 or earlier to 4.0 or later, you must manually add new items to the *ClusterSettings* section of your existing ``config.json``. For more information about this, see the *Upgrading to Version 4.0 and Later* section of :doc:`../deployment/cluster`.
 - Microsoft Edge v39 and earlier (EdgeHTML v14 and earlier) has [an issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/8546263/) that may case errors during account creation, login and if MFA is enforced. We recommend upgrading to Edge v40 (or EdgeHTML v15).

#### Removed and deprecated features
- System Console settings in **Files > Images** removed. This includes:
  - Image preview height and width
  - Profile picture height and width
  - Image thumbnail height and width
- Font setting in Account Settings > Display removed.
- Account Settings option **Display** > **Teammate Name Display** moved to the System Console.
- All APIv3 endpoints are scheduled for removal on January 16, 2018.

For a list of past and upcoming deprecated features, [see our website](https://about.mattermost.com/deprecated-features/).

#### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json`, or the System Console when available.

**Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition**:

- Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Added `"EnableEmojiPicker": true` to control whether emoji picker is enabled on the server. Enabling the emoji picker with a large number of custom emoji may slow down performance.
   - Added `"EnableChannelViewedMessages": true` to control whether `channel_viewed` WebSocket event is sent, which syncs unreads across clients and devices. Setting to false can lead to higher performance in large deployments.
   - Added `"EnableAPIv3": true` to control whether version 3 endpoints of the REST API are allowed on the server. If the setting is disabled, integrations that rely on API v3 will fail and can then be identified for migration to API v4.
- Under `TeamSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Added `"TeammateNameDisplay": "username"` to set how to display users' names in posts and the Direct Messages list. Deployments with LDAP or SAML enabled will have this set to `full_name` by default for better experience.
- Under `FileSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Removed System Console settings in **Files > Images**, including:
     - `"ThumbnailWidth": 120`
     - `"ThumbnailHeight": 100`
     - `"PreviewWidth": 1024`
     - `"PreviewHeight": 0`
     - `"ProfileWidth": 128`
     - `"ProfileHeight": 128`
- Under `SqlSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Modified `"QueryTimeout": 30` to also support query timeouts on PostgreSQL, in addition to MySQL.

**Additional Changes to Enterprise Edition**:

- Under `ClusterSettings` in `config.json`:
   - Added `"ClusterName": ""` to set the cluster to join by name. Only nodes with the same cluster name will join together. This is to support Blue-Green deployments or staging pointing to the same database.
   - Added `"OverrideHostname": ""` to override the hostname of this server with this property. It is not recommended to override the Hostname unless needed.
   - Added `"UseIpAddress": true` to control whether the cluster attempts to communicate using the IP Address.
   - Added `"UseExperimentalGossip": false` to control whether the server attempts to communicate via the gossip protocol over the gossip port.
   - Added `"ReadOnlyConfig": true` to control whether changes made to settings in the System Console are ignored. When running in production it is recommended to set this value to true.
   - Added `"GossipPort": 8074` to set the port used for the gossip protocol. Both UDP and TCP should be allowed on this port.
   - Added `"StreamingPort": 8075` to set the port used for streaming data between servers.
   - Removed ``"InterNodeListenAddress": ":8075"`` as this setting is no longer used.
   - Removed ``"InterNodeUrls": []`` as this setting is no longer used.

### API v4 Changes
- Mattermost 4.0 has a stable release of API v4 endpoints. It is recommended that any new integrations use the v4 endpoints. For more details, and for a complete list of available endpoints, see [https://api.mattermost.com/](https://api.mattermost.com/).
- All APIv3 endpoints are scheduled for removal on January 16, 2018.

**Added routes (API v4)**
- `GET` at `/teams/invite/{invite_id}`
  - To retrieve information about a team (including the name and id) corresponding to an invite_id.

**Modified routes (API v4)**
- `DELETE` at `/teams/{team_id}`
  - Added an optional query parameter, `permanent`, to permanently delete a team for compliance reasons.

### Websocket Event Changes

**Added:**
- `channel_updated` that occurs each time channel information is updated (such as name or header), so that the changes are propagated across clients.

- Sometimes no email verification is sent to the new email address after changing your email in Account Settings. A workaround is to sign in with the new email address and hitting "Resend Email" on the "Email not verified" page
- Clicking "Load more messages" sometimes brings you to the bottom of the page
- Switching to a channel with unreads sometimes doesn't jump to the correct scrolling position

### Compatibility
Changes from v3.3 to v3.4:

**Special Note**

#### config.json

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json` or the System Console.

**Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition**:

 - Under `EmailSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"EnableEmailBatching": false` to enable batching of email notifications configurable in Account Settings. To enable email batching, the `SiteURL` field must be filled out and `Enable` under `ClusterSettings` must be set to `false` to disable high availability mode.
    - Added `"EmailBatchingBufferSize": 256` to specify the maximum number of notifications batched into a single email.
    - Added `"EmailBatchingInterval": 30` to specify the maximum frequency, in seconds, which the batching job checks for new notifications.

 - Under `LogSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"EnableDiagnostics": true` to increase reliability and performance of Mattermost for your deployment configuration by sending encrypted [error reporting and diagnostic information](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-diagnostics-and-error-reporting) to Mattermost, Inc.

**Additional Changes to Enterprise Edition:**

The following config settings will only work on servers with an Enterprise License that has the feature enabled.

- Under `LdapSettings` in `config.json`:
    - `"FirstNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field
    - `"LastNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field
- Under `SamlSettings` in `config.json`:
    - `"FirstNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field
    - `"LastNameAttribute": ""` is no longer a required field

### Database Changes from v3.3 to v3.4

 - Added `ActiveChannel` column.

### API Changes from v3.3 to v3.4

**New routes:**
 - Added `GET` at `/oauth/authorized`
     - Returns the OAuth2 Apps authorized by the user.  On success it returns a list of sanitized OAuth2 Authorized Apps by the user.
 - Added `POST` at `/oauth/"+clientId+"/deauthorize`
     - Deauthorizes a user on an OAuth 2.0 app, where `clientId` corresponds to the application. Returns status OK on success or an AppError on fail.
 - Added `POST` at `/oauth/"+clientId+"/regen_secret`
     - Generates a new OAuth App Client Secret, where `clientId` corresponds to the application. Returns an OAuth2 App on success. Must be authenticated as a user and the same user who registered the app or a System Admin.
 - Added `POST` at `/admin/ldap_test`
     - Will run a connection test on the current LDAP settings. It will return the standard OK response if settings work. Otherwise it will return an appropriate error.
 - Added `POST` at `/users/status/set_active_channel`
     - Sets the Status.ActiveChannel field which is used to tell if the user is actively viewing a channel or not.
 - Added `GET` at `/admin/recently_active_users/{teamId}`
     - Returns a list of recent active users.

### Known Issues

- Upgrading from 3.2 to 3.4 will be incomplete due to a migration code not being run properly. You can either:
    - Upgrade from 3.2 to 3.3 and then from 3.3 to 3.4, or
    - Upgrade from 3.2 to 3.4, then run the following SQL query to make Mattermost rerun upgrade steps that were not properly completed: `UPDATE Systems SET Value = '3.1.0' WHERE Name = 'Version';`
- Deleted messages don't disappear from the channel for the user who deleted the message, if the message was previously edited and right hand sidebar is open.
- A single collapsed link or image preview re-opens after refresh.
- Files sent in private chat to members in a different team are not accessible.
- YouTube video links show as “Video not found” on Desktop App if "Allow mixed content" is turned on.
- “More” option under Direct Message list no longer shows count of team members not in your direct message list.

## Release v1.2.1

- **Released:** 2015-11-16

### Security Notice

Mattermost v1.2.1 is a Quality Release addressing a security issue in v1.2.0 affecting a newly introduced outgoing webhooks feature. Specifically, in v1.2.0 there was a check missing from outgoing webhooks, so a team member creating outgoing webhooks could in theory find a way to listen to messages in private channels containing popular words like "a", "the", "at", etc. For added security, Mattermost v1.2.1 now installs with incoming and outgoing webhooks disabled by default.

To limit the impact of this security issue, Mattermost v1.2.0 has been removed from the source repo. It is recommended that anyone who's installed v1.2.0 upgrade to v1.2.1 via [the procedure described in the Mattermost Upgrade Guide](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#upgrade-team-edition-for-2-2-x-and-earlier).

- A community application, [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge?files=1), shows how to use webhooks to connect Mattermost with IRC

#### Search Scope Modifiers

- Adding search term `in:[channel_url_name]` now limits searches within a specific channel
- Adding search term `from:[username]` now limits searches to messages from a specific user

#### Syntax Highlighting

- Syntax highlight for code blocks now available for `Diff, Apache, Makefile, HTTP, JSON, Markdown, JavaScript, CSS, nginx, ObjectiveC, Python, XML, Perl, Bash, PHP, CoffeeScript, C, SQL, Go, Ruby, Java, and ini`

## Release v1.2.0 (Redacted Release)

- **Final release:** 2015-11-16 (**Note:** This release was removed from public availability and replaced by v1.2.1 owing to a security issue with the new outgoing webhooks feature. See v1.2.1 Release Notes for details).

## Release v1.1.1 (Quality Release)

Released 2015-10-20

### About Quality Releases

This is a Quality Release (v1.1.1) and recommended only for users needing a fix to the specific issue listed below. All other users should use the most recent major stable build release (v1.1.0).

[View more information on Mattermost release numbering](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/release-process.html#release-numbering).

### Release Purpose

#### Provide option for upgrading database from Mattermost v0.7 to v1.1

Upgrading Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1 originally required installing Mattermost v1.0 to upgrade from the Mattermost v0.7 database, followed by an install of Mattermost v1.1.

This was problematic for installing Mattermost with GitLab omnibus since GitLab 8.0 contained Mattermost v0.7 and GitLab 8.1 was to include Mattermost v1.1

Therefore Mattermost v1.1.1 was created that can upgrade the database in Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1 directly.

Users who configured Mattermost v0.7 within GitLab via the `config.json` file should consult [documentation on upgrading configurations from Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#upgrade-team-edition-for-2-2-x-and-earlier).

#### Removes 32-char limit on salts

Mattermost v1.1 introduced a 32-char limit on salts that broke the salt generating in GitLab and this restriction was removed for 1.1.1.

## Release v1.1.0

Released: 2015-10-16

### Release Highlights

#### Incoming Webhooks

Mattermost now supports incoming webhooks for channels and private groups. This developer feature is available from the Account Settings -> Integrations menu. Documentation on how developers can use the webhook functionality to build custom integrations, along with samples, is available at http://mattermost.org/webhooks.

### Improvements

Integrations

- Improved support for incoming webhooks, including the ability to override a username and post as a bot instead

Documentation

- Added documentation on config.json and System Console settings
- Docker Toolbox replaces deprecated Boot2Docker instructions in container install documentation

Theme Colors

- Improved appearance of dark themes

System Console

- Client side errors now written to server logs
- Added "EnableSecurityFixAlert" option to receive alerts on relevant security fix alerts
- Various improvements to System Console UI and help text

Messaging and Notifications

- Replaced "Quiet Mode" in the Channel Notification Settings with an option to only show unread indicator when mentioned

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed regression causing "Get Public Link" on images not to work
- Fixed bug where certain characters caused search errors
- Fixed bug where System Administrator did not have Team Administrator permissions
- Fixed bug causing scrolling to jump when the right hand sidebar opened and closed

### Known Issues

- Slack import is unstable due to change in Slack export format
- Uploading a .flac file breaks the file previewer on iOS

### Compatibility

#### Config.json Changes from v1.0 to v1.1

##### Service Settings

Multiple settings were added to `config.json` and System Console UI. Prior to upgrading the Mattermost binaries from the previous versions, these options would need to be manually updated in existing config.json file. This is a list of changes and their new default values in a fresh install:
- Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`:
  - Added: `"EnablePostIconOverride": false` to control whether webhooks can override profile pictures
  - Added: `"EnablePostUsernameOverride": false` to control whether webhooks can override profile pictures
  - Added: `"EnableSecurityFixAlert": true` to control whether the system is alerted to security updates

#### Database Changes from v1.0 to v1.1

The following is for informational purposes only, no action needed. Mattermost automatically upgrades database tables from the previous version's schema using only additions. Sessions table is dropped and rebuilt, no team data is affected by this.

##### ChannelMembers Table
1. Removed `NotifyLevel` column
2. Added `NotifyProps` column with type `varchar(2000)` and default value `{}`

### Compatibility

## Release v0.7.0 (Beta1)

Released 2015-09-05

### Release Highlights

#### Improved GitLab Mattermost support

Following the release of Mattermost v0.6.0 Alpha, GitLab 7.14 offered an automated install of Mattermost with GitLab Single Sign-On (co-branded as "GitLab Mattermost") in its omnibus installer.

New features, improvements, and bug fixes recommended by the GitLab community were incorporated into Mattermost v0.7.0 Beta1--in particular, extending support of GitLab SSO to team creation, and restricting team creation to users with verified emails from a configurable list of domains.

#### Slack Import (Preview)

Preview of Slack import functionality supports the processing of an "Export" file from Slack containing account information and public channel archives from a Slack team.

- In the feature preview, emails and usernames from Slack are used to create new Mattermost accounts, which users can activate by going to the Password Reset screen in Mattermost to set new credentials.
- Once logged in, users will have access to previous Slack messages shared in public channels, now imported to Mattermost.

Limitations:

- Slack does not export files or images your team has stored in Slack's database. Mattermost will provide links to the location of your assets in Slack's web UI.
- Slack does not export any content from private groups or direct messages that your team has stored in Slack's database.
- The Preview release of Slack Import does not offer pre-checks or roll-back and will not import Slack accounts with username or email address collisions with existing Mattermost accounts. Also, Slack channel names with underscores will not import. Also, mentions do not yet resolve as Mattermost usernames (still show Slack ID). These issues are being addressed in [Mattermost v0.8.0 Migration Support](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-22?filter=10002).
