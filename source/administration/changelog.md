#### config.json   

Multiple setting options were added to `config.json`. Below is a list of the additions and their default values on install. The settings can be modified in `config.json` or the System Console. 

**Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition**:

 - Under `EmailSettings` in `config.json`:
    - Added `"EnableEmailBatching": false` to enable batching of email notifications configurable in Account Settings. To enable email batching, the `SiteURL` field must be filled out and `Enable` under `ClusterSettings` must be set to `false` to disable high availability mode.
    - Added `"EmailBatchingBufferSize": 256` to specify the maximum number of notifications batched into a single email.
    - Added `"EmailBatchingInterval": 30` to specify the maximum frequency, in seconds, which the batching job checks for new notifications.

## Release v1.2.1

- **Released:** 2015-11-16

### Security Notice

Mattermost v1.2.1 is a bug fix release addressing a security issue in v1.2.0 affecting a newly introduced outgoing webhooks feature. Specifically, in v1.2.0 there was a check missing from outgoing webhooks, so a team member creating outgoing webhooks could in theory find a way to listen to messages in private channels containing popular words like "a", "the", "at", etc. For added security, Mattermost v1.2.1 now installs with incoming and outgoing webhooks disabled by default. 

To limit the impact of this security issue, Mattermost v1.2.0 has been removed from the source repo. It is recommended that anyone who's installed v1.2.0 upgrade to v1.2.1 via [the procedure described in the Mattermost Upgrade Guide](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#upgrade-team-edition-for-2-2-x-and-earlier).

- A community application, [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge?files=1), shows how to use webhooks to connect Mattermost with IRC 

#### Search Scope Modifiers 

- Adding search term `in:[channel_url_name]` now limits searches within a specific channel
- Adding search term `from:[username]` now limits searches to messages from a specific user

#### Syntax Highlighting 

- Syntax highlight for code blocks now available for `Diff, Apache, Makefile, HTTP, JSON, Markdown, JavaScript, CSS, nginx, ObjectiveC, Python, XML, Perl, Bash, PHP, CoffeeScript, C, SQL, Go, Ruby, Java, and ini`

- Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`
  - Added: `"EnableOutgoingWebhooks": false` to control whether outgoing webhooks are enabled
  - Changed: `"EnableIncomingWebhooks": true` to `"EnableIncomingWebhooks": false` to turn incoming webhooks off by default, to increase security of default install. Documentation updated to enable webhooks before use. 

#### Database Changes from v1.1 to v1.2

## Release v1.2.0 (Redacted Release)

- **Final release:** 2015-11-16 (**Note:** This release was removed from public availability and replaced by v1.2.1 owing to a security issue with the new outgoing webhooks feature. See v1.2.1 Release Notes for details).

## Release v1.1.1 (Bug Fix Release) 

Released 2015-10-20 

### About Bug Fix Releases

This is a bug fix release (v1.1.1) and recommended only for users needing a fix to the specific issue listed below. All other users should use the most recent major stable build release (v1.1.0). 

[View more information on Mattermost release numbering](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/release-process.html#release-numbering).

### Release Purpose

#### Provide option for upgrading database from Mattermost v0.7 to v1.1

Upgrading Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1 originally required installing Mattermost v1.0 to upgrade from the Mattermost v0.7 database, followed by an install of Mattermost v1.1. 

This was problematic for installing Mattermost with GitLab omnibus since GitLab 8.0 contained Mattermost v0.7 and GitLab 8.1 was to include Mattermost v1.1

Therefore Mattermost v1.1.1 was created that can upgrade the database in Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1 directly. 

Users who configured Mattermost v0.7 within GitLab via the `config.json` file should consult [documentation on upgrading configurations from Mattermost v0.7 to Mattermost v1.1](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html#upgrade-team-edition-for-2-2-x-and-earlier).

#### Removes 32-char limit on salts 

Mattermost v1.1 introduced a 32-char limit on salts that broke the salt generating in GitLab and this restriction was removed for 1.1.1. 

## Release v1.1.0

Released: 2015-10-16

### Release Highlights

#### Incoming Webhooks

Mattermost now supports incoming webhooks for channels and private groups. This developer feature is available from the Account Settings -> Integrations menu. Documentation on how developers can use the webhook functionality to build custom integrations, along with samples, is available at http://mattermost.org/webhooks.

#### Config.json Changes from v1.0 to v1.1 

##### Service Settings 

Multiple settings were added to [`config.json`](./config/config.json) and System Console UI. Prior to upgrading the Mattermost binaries from the previous versions, these options would need to be manually updated in existing config.json file.

- Under `ServiceSettings` in `config.json`:
  - Added: `"EnablePostIconOverride": false` to control whether webhooks can override profile pictures
  - Added: `"EnablePostUsernameOverride": false` to control whether webhooks can override profile pictures
  - Added: `"EnableSecurityFixAlert": true` to control whether the system is alerted to security updates

#### Database Changes from v1.0 to v1.1

## Release v0.7.0 (Beta1) 

Released 2015-09-05

### Release Highlights

#### Improved GitLab Mattermost support 

Following the release of Mattermost v0.6.0 Alpha, GitLab 7.14 offered an automated install of Mattermost with GitLab Single-Sign-On (co-branded as "GitLab Mattermost") in its omnibus installer.

New features, improvements, and bug fixes recommended by the GitLab community were incorporated into Mattermost v0.7.0 Beta1--in particular, extending support of GitLab SSO to team creation, and restricting team creation to users with verified emails from a configurable list of domains.

#### Slack Import (Preview)

Preview of Slack import functionality supports the processing of an "Export" file from Slack containing account information and public channel archives from a Slack team.   

- In the feature preview, emails and usernames from Slack are used to create new Mattermost accounts, which users can activate by going to the Password Reset screen in Mattermost to set new credentials. 
- Once logged in, users will have access to previous Slack messages shared in public channels, now imported to Mattermost.  

Limitations: 

- Slack does not export files or images your team has stored in Slack's database. Mattermost will provide links to the location of your assets in Slack's web UI.
- Slack does not export any content from private groups or direct messages that your team has stored in Slack's database. 
- The Preview release of Slack Import does not offer pre-checks or roll-back and will not import Slack accounts with username or email address collisions with existing Mattermost accounts. Also, Slack channel names with underscores will not import. Also, mentions do not yet resolve as Mattermost usernames (still show Slack ID). These issues are being addressed in [Mattermost v0.8.0 Migration Support](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-22?filter=10002).

### New Features 

GitLab Mattermost 

- Ability to create teams using GitLab SSO (previously GitLab SSO only supported account creation and sign-in)
- Ability to restrict team creation to GitLab SSO and/or users with email verified from a specific list of domains.

File and Image Sharing 

- New drag-and-drop file sharing to messages and comments 
- Ability to paste images from clipboard to messages and comments 

Messaging, Comments and Notifications 

- Send messages faster with from optimistic posting and retry on failure 

Documentation 

- New style guidelines for Go, React and Javascript 

### Improvements

Messaging, Comments and Notifications 

- Performance improvements to channel rendering
- Added "Unread posts" in left hand sidebar when notification indicator is off-screen

Documentation 

- Install documentation improved based on early adopter feedback

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed multiple issues with GitLab SSO, installation and on-boarding 
- Fixed multiple IE 10 issues 
- Fixed broken link in verify email function 
- Fixed public links not working on mobile
