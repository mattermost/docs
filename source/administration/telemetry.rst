Telemetry
=========

As described in the privacy policy in each Mattermost server, telemetry data optionally shared from your Mattermost servers is used to identify security and reliability issues, to analyze and fix software problems, to help improve the quality of Mattermost software and related services, and to make design decisions for future releases.

Telemetry data is encrypted in transit, does not include personally identifiable information or message contents, and details of how the information is used and processed is available in our `Privacy Policy <https://about.mattermost.com/default-privacy-policy/>`__.

We use the data for the following purposes:

  - To identify security and reliability issues.
  - To analyze and fix software problems.
  - To help improve the quality of Mattermost software and related services.
  - To make design decisions for future releases.

Security Update Check Feature
-----------------------------

New threats to system security constantly arise. To alert you of relevant, high priority security updates, Mattermost servers are configured to share diagnostic information with Mattermost Inc. so that we can provide appropriate alerts.

The following data is collected once every 24 hours:
  - Mattermost server build number and version
  - Type of build (Enterprise Edition or Team Edition)
  - Server operating system
  - The server diagnostic ID (same as the ID accessing the push notification proxy, and is used to prevent double-counting of telemetry data)
  - Database type
  - Database version
  - Number of teams
  - Number of users 
  - Number of active users
  - Whether or not the unit tests have been run
  - Date and time of the last check for security updates
  - The location of the Amazon Cloudfront server used for telemetry data

To opt out, disable the feature in **System Console > Environment > SMTP** (or **System Console > Notifications > Email > Enable Security Alerts** in versions prior to 5.12). When the feature is disabled, you will not receive any security alerts.

Error and Diagnostics Reporting Feature
---------------------------------------

Mattermost error and diagnostic data is collected for the following purposes:
  - To add improvements that are specific to your usage and deployment patterns, including identifying security and reliability issues.
  - To analyze and fix software problems.
  - To help improve the quality of Mattermost software and related services.
  - To make design decisions for future releases.

.. note:: 
Error and diagnostic reporting is sent by the client to the endpoint ``api.segment.io``. From Mattermost version 5.23 the segment endpoint is being deprecated in favor of ``https://pdat.matterlytics.com``, a custom Rudder domain. To opt out, you can disable the feature in **System Console > Environment > Logging > Enable Diagnostics and Error Reporting**. Starting in Mattermost version 5.26, when this feature is enabled, any 500 errors will be automatically sent to the Mattermost-hosted `Sentry <https://sentry.io/welcome/>`_ endpoint.

Incident Management Telemetry
-----------------------------

The following list details the types of Incident Management metadata we collect:

**Data collected for all event types**

- ``PluginVersion``: Version of the plugin.
- ``ServerVersion``: Version of the server the plugin is running on.
- ``UserID``: Unique identifier of the server.
- ``Event``: Type of the event. There are three event types that are tracked: ``incident``, ``tasks``, ``playbook``.
- ``UserActualID``: Unique identifier of the user who initiated the action.

**Data collected in incident events**

- ``IncidentID``: Unique identifier of the incident.
- ``IsActive``: Boolean value indicating if the incident is active.
- ``CommanderUserID``: Unique identifier of the commander of the incident.
- ``TeamID``: Unique identifier of the team where the incident channel is created.
- ``CreatedAt``: Timestamp of the incident creation.
- ``PostID``: Unique identifier of the post from which the incident was created (if relevant).
- ``NumChecklists``: Number of stages in this incident.
- ``TotalChecklistItems``: Number of tasks in this incident.
- ``ActiveStage``: A number indicating the stage of the incident (0-based).
- ``Action``: The type of action performed against the incident: ``create``, ``end``, ``restart``, ``change_stage``, ``change_commander``, ``update_status``.
- ``Public``: When creating an incident, ``true`` if it is public, and ``false`` if it is private.
- ``ReminderTimerSeconds``: The next timer for the reminder to update the status, in seconds. It's tracked only when ``Action`` equals ``update_status``.

**Data collected in tasks events**

- ``Action``: The type of action performed against the task: ``add_task``, ``remove_task``, ``rename_task``, ``modify_task_state``, ``move_task``, ``set_assignee_for_task``, ``run_task_slash_command``.
- ``NewState``: When modifying a task state, ``true`` if the task is now checked, ``false`` if the task is now unchecked.
- ``WasCommander``: When modifying a task state, ``true`` if the userId who initiated the event was also the commander of the event, and ``false`` otherwise.
- ``WasAssignee``: When modifying a task state, ``true`` if the userId who initiated the event was also the assignee of the event, and ``false`` otherwise.

**Data collected in playbook events**

Error and diagnostic reporting is sent by the client to the endpoint ``api.segment.io``. To opt out, disable the feature in **System Console > Environment > Logging** (or **System Console > General > Logging > Enable Error and Diagnostics Reporting** in versions prior to 5.12).

Android Mobile App Performance Monitoring
-----------------------------------------

To improve Android app performance, we are collecting trace events and device information, collectively known as metrics, to identify slow performing key areas. Those metrics will be sent only from users using Android app beta build starting in version v1.20, who are logged in to servers that allow sending `diagnostic information <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-diagnostics-and-error-reporting>`__.

Trace events
  Includes duration on how long the action took place like startup, team/channel switch, posts loading/update and channel drawer open/close. The naming convention is interpreted as ``[start observation]:[end observation]``, e.g. ``start:overall`` as from app start until fully rendered or ``post_list:thread`` as on press of post at post list until thread is opened.
  Complete list of trace events are the following:

  - start:overall
  - start:process_packages
  - start:content_appeared
  - start:select_server_screen
  - start:channel_screen
  - team:switch
  - channel:loading
  - channel:switch_loaded
