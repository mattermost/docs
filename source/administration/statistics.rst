Statistics
==========

Statistics on users, posts, and channels are tracked for each system and team. Enterprise Editions have access to advanced system statistics.

.. note::

  To maximize performance for large Enterprise deployments, statistics for total posts, total hashtag posts, total file posts, posts per day, and active users with posts per day are disabled. You can re-enable them by changing the ``MaxUsersForStatistics`` value `in config.json <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#maximum-users-for-statistics>`__.

For advanced metrics for Enterprise deployments, `see performance monitoring documentation to learn more <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/metrics.html>`__.

Troubleshooting/FAQ
-------------------

I see an error: "Not enough data for a meaningful representation"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the statistics page is loading endlessly and you get an error message saying "Not enough data for a meaningful representation", check whether you're using an ad blocker. An ad blocker can prevent this page from loading data. To test this, temporarily disable your ad blocker, or view the page in a browser without an ad blocker installed.

Can Team Admins review their own team's statistics?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available in Enterprise Edition E20.*

System Admins can designate the **Viewer** `System Admin Role <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/admin-roles.html>`__ to enable Team Admins to see team statistics.

Once Team Admins are assigned to the **Viewer** role, they can access all statistics for all teams.

System Admins must then `edit the privileges <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/admin-roles.html#editing-privileges-of-admin-roles-advanced>`__ of the **Viewer** role. Only the **Reporting** privileges need to be enabled to allow Team Admins to see statistics for their teams.

Once the **Viewer** role is set up for reporting access only, System Admins can then `assign <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/admin-roles.html#assigning-admin-roles>`__ the **Viewer** role to Team Admins.

.. note::

  - System Admins must manually add people to or remove people from the **Viewer** admin role to address Team Admin changes, such as promotions or demotions.
  - Team Admins using the **Viewer** admin role will also have access to system-level statistics in addition to statistics for their teams.
