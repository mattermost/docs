Important Upgrade Notes
=======================

.. important::
   PostgreSQL ended long-term support for `version 9.4 in February 2020 <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning>`_. Mattermost will officially be supporting PostgreSQL version 10 with v5.26 release as PostgreSQL 9.4 is no longer supported. New installs will require PostgreSQL 10+. Previous Mattermost versions, including our current ESR, will continue to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4. In our 6.0 release (date to be announced), we plan on fully deprecating PostgreSQL 9.4. Please follow the instructions under the Upgrading Section within `the PostgreSQL documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/>`_.
   
.. important::
   Support for server `Extended Support Release <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html>`_ (ESR) 5.19 is coming to the end of its lifecycle on October 15th, 2020. Upgrading to server v5.25 or later is highly recommended.

.. important::
   Starting with mobile app v1.33.0 releasing on July 16th, users connecting to server versions below v5.19 may experience compatibility bugs with how attachments, link previews, reactions and embed data are displayed on their mobile device.
