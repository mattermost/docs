Important Upgrade Notes
=======================

.. important::
   Support for Mattermost Server v5.25 `Extended Support Release <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html>`_ is coming to the end of its life cycle on April 16, 2021. Upgrading to Mattermost Server v5.31 `Extended Support Release <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html>`_ or later is highly recommended.

.. important::
   PostgreSQL ended long-term support for `version 9.4 in February 2020 <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning>`_. From v5.26 Mattermost officially supports PostgreSQL version 10 as PostgreSQL 9.4 is no longer supported. New installs will require PostgreSQL 10+. Previous Mattermost versions, including our current ESR, will continue to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4. PostgreSQL 9.4 and all 9.x versions are now fully deprecated in our v5.30 release (December 16, 2020). Please follow the instructions under the Upgrading Section within `the PostgreSQL documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/>`_.

.. important::
   TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 have been deprecated by browser vendors. Starting in Mattermost Server v5.32 (February 16), mmctl returns an error when connected to Mattermost servers deployed with these TLS versions and System Admins will need to explicitly add a flag in their commands to continue to use them. We recommend upgrading to TLS version 1.2 or higher.

.. important::
   The ``platform`` binary and “--platform” flag will be deprecated in a future release. If you are using the “--platform” flag or are using the ``platform`` binary directly to run the Mattermost server application via a systemd file or custom script, you will be required to use only the ``mattermost`` binary.
