Mattermost 3.6 and later
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new CLI tool is supported in Mattermost 3.6 and later. To see available commands in the old CLI tool, see `Mattermost 3.5 and earlier`_.

Typing ``sudo ./platform help`` and ``sudo ./platform help {command}`` returns help documentation for the CLI tool or any CLI command in particular.

To return the help documentation in GitLab omnibus, type

    .. code-block:: none

      sudo -u mattermost /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/mattermost --config=/var/opt/gitlab/mattermost/config.json help

Notes:

-  Parameters in CLI commands are order-specific.
-  If special characters (``!``, ``|``, ``(``, ``)``, ``\``, ``'``, and ``"``) are used, the entire argument needs to be surrounded by single quotes (e.g. ``-password 'mypassword!'``, or the individual characters need to be escaped out (e.g. ``-password mypassword\!``).
-  Team name and channel name refer to the handles, not the display names. So in the url ``https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/town-square`` team name would be ``core`` and channel name would be ``town-square``

.. tip::
   If you automate user creation through the CLI tool with SMTP enabled, emails will be sent to all new users created. If you run such a load script, it is best to disable SMTP or to use test accounts so that new account creation emails aren't unintentionally sent to people at your organization who aren't expecting them.

Notes:

- Parameters in CLI commands are order-specific.
