Incidents and playbooks are associated with teams in Mattermost. Incident channels are created based on playbooks, which define whether an incident channel is public or private. Read more about [public and private channels](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/organizing-conversations.html).

Only members of the team in which the playbook or incident is defined have access. Playbook membership is independent of incident membership.

- Members of a playbook may start an incident using that playbook, and edit the playbook's stages and steps.
- Members of an incident may modify the current state of the incident, and invite new members to the incident channel.
