Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Can users connect their Mattermost account to a different Microsoft Teams account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Currently, only accounts with the same email addresses are allowed to be connected. Specify the email address that matches your Mattermost account. 

If connecting a Mattermost account to a Microsoft Teams account with a different email address is something your workspace requires, there is an open `GitHub issue <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams/issues/519>`__ for you to share your feedback.

How is encryption handled at rest and in motion?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything is stored in the Mattermost databases. AES encryption is used to encrypt the MS Teams auth/access token. Other encryption at rest would be dependent on how the Mattermost instance is setup. All communication between the integration and MS Teams/Graph API are conducted over SSL/HTTPS.

Are there any database or network security considerations?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is nothing specific to the integration that is beyond what would apply to a Mattermost instance.

Are there any compliance considerations (ie. GDPR, PCI)?

There is nothing specific to the integration that is beyond what would apply to a Mattermost instance.
