Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Can I connect my Mattermost account to a Microsoft Teams account of a different email address?

No. Currently, only accounts with the same email addresses are allowed to be connected. Specify the email address that matches your Mattermost account. 

If connecting a Mattermost account to a Microsoft Teams account with a different email address is something your workspace requires, there is an open `GitHub issue <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams/issues/519>`__ for you to share your feedback.
