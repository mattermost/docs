Setup
-----

Create an MS Teams app in Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Sign in to the `Azure portal <https://portal.azure.com/>`_ using an admin Azure account.

2. Go to your **Azure Portal > Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. Go to **App registrations**.

4. Create a new app registration by selecting **Add > App registration**:

  - Give it a name
  - Accounts in this organizational directory only (single tenant)
  - No redirect URIs

5. Go to your newly created application and copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** values. You'll need those later to configure the plugin.

7. Go to **API Permissions** to complete the following steps:

  - Ensure the ``User.Read`` **delegated** permission is added. See the `Microsoft SSO documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad#enable-sso-in-microsoft-entra-id>`_ for details.
  - Add the ``TeamsActivity.Send`` **application** permission for notifications. See the `Microsoft notifications documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-send-activityfeednotifications?tabs=desktop%2Chttp>`_ for details.`
  - Add the ``AppCatalog.Read.All`` **application** permission for notifications. See the `Microsoft List teamsApp documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/appcatalogs-list-teamsapps?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http>`_ for details.
  - Grant admin consent for the default directory to prevent users from seeing the consent prompt.

8. Go to **Expose an API** to complete the following steps:

  - Edit the ``_Application ID URI_`` to ``api://{{Mattermost Site URL Hostname}}/{{Application (client) ID}}``.
  - Add the ``access_as_user`` scope by selecting **Add a scope** and setting the following values:

    - **Scope name**: ``access_as_user``.
    - **Who can consent?** Admins and users
    - Provide a display name and description, as well as a user consent display name and description. These will be shown to end users on the consent screen. For example:

      - **Display name**: Log in to Mattermost
      - **Description**: Used to allow O365 users to log in to the Mattermost application 
      - **User consent display name**: Log in to Mattermost
      - **User consent description**: This permission is required to automatically log you in into Mattermost from Microsoft applications.

    See the `Microsoft API scope documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad#to-configure-api-scope>`_ for details.

    - Add authorised client applications for the scope. See the `Microsoft authorized client documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad#to-configure-authorized-client-application>`_ for details.

      - Select ``_Add a client application_``. **You must add a client application for each target Microsoft application**:

        - **Authorised scopes**: The one we just created

          - **Client ID**:

            - **Teams web**: 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346
            - **Teams app**: 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264
            - **Outlook desktop** : d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c
            - **Outlook web**     : bc59ab01-8403-45c6-8796-ac3ef710b3e3
            

    - If you want to make your application available in more Microsoft applications, keep adding client applications from `the following table <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad#to-configure-authorized-client-application:~:text=Select%20one%20of%20the%20following%20client%20IDs%3A>`_.

Usage
------

This plugin supports automatic authentication when logged into Microsoft Teams. Teams authentication automatically logs users into Mattermost if the email addresses in both platforms match exactly. Regular authentication methods (LDAP, SAML, email/password, OpenID) can additionally be used for Mattermost.

In air-gapped environments or during business continuity disruptions, users who can't join Microsoft Teams, can continue to access Mattermost using their Mattermost credentials by opening Mattermost in a separate app (e.g., in a new browser window). Alternatively, a Mattermost admin can pre-distribute the Mattermost desktop app using Windows MSI or the mobile app via EMM.
