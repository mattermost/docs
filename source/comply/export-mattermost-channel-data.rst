Ensure important data isn't trapped in silos by migrating data between systems or backing data up for operational continuity. Once exported, channel data can be analyzed using various tools for insights into team dynamics, productivity, and communication patterns, and to fulfill reporting and auditability requirements.

.. note::

  For Mattermost Cloud deployments, no setup is required. See the `usage <#usage>`__ section below for details on exporting channel data.

For self-hosted deployments, a Mattermost system admin must perform the following steps in Mattermost.

1. Log in to your Mattermost :doc:`workspace </guides/use-mattermost>` as a system administrator.
2. Download the latest version of `the plugin binary release <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-export/releases>`__, compatible with Mattermost v8.0.1 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Mattermost, :doc:`follow our documentation </upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server>` to upgrade to Mattermost v8.0.1 or later.
3. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management > Upload Plugin**, and upload the plugin binary you downloaded in the previous step.
4. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management**. In the **Installed Plugins** section, scroll to **Channel Export**, and select **Enable**.

Upgrade
-------

We recommend upgrading this feature as new versions are released. Generally, updates are seamless and don't interrupt the user experience in Mattermost. Visit the `Releases page <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-export/releases>`__ for the latest release, available releases, and compatibiilty considerations.

Usage
------

You need to be a Mattermost system admin to export channel data.

Use the ``/export`` slash command in a channel to export the current channel's message data into a CSV-formatted file.
