# Using the GitLab-Unicorn Chart

The `unicorn` sub-chart provides the gitlab rails web-server running two unicorn workers per pod. (The minimum necessary for a single pod to be able to serve any web request in GitLab)

Currently the container used in the chart also includes a copy of gitlab-workhorse, which we haven't yet split out.

## Requirements

This chart depends on Redis, PostgreSQL, Gitaly, and Registry services, either as part of the complete GitLab chart or provided as external services reachable from the Kubernetes cluster this chart is deployed onto.

# Configuration

The `unicorn` chart is configured as follows: Global Settings, Ingress Settings External Services, and Chart Settings.

## Installation command line options

Table below contains all the possible charts configurations that can be supplied to `helm install` command using the `--set` flags

## Chart configuration examples
### image.pullSecrets
`pullSecrets` allow you to authenticate to a private registry to pull images for a pod.

Additional details about private registries and their authentication methods
can be found in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).

Below is an example use of `pullSecrets`
```YAML
image:
  repository: my.unicorn.repository
  pullPolicy: Always
  pullSecrets:
  - name: my-secret-name
  - name: my-secondary-secret-name
```

## Using the Community Edition of this chart

By default, the Helm charts use the Enterprise Edition of GitLab. If desired, you can instead use the Community Edition. Learn more about the [difference between the two](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/ce-or-ee/).

In order to use the Community Edition, set `image.repository` to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-unicorn-ce`
and `workhorse.image` to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-workhorse-ce`

## Global Settings

We share some common global settings among our charts. See the [Globals Documentation][globals] for common configuration
options, such as GitLab and Registry hostnames.

## Ingress Settings

|name|type|default|
|:---|:---|:------|
|[ingress.enabled](#ingress-enabled)|boolean|false|
|[ingress.tls.secretName](#ingress-tls-secretName)|string|(empty)|
|[ingress.annotations.*annotation-key*](#ingress-annotations-annotation-key)|string|(empty)|

### ingress.enabled

Setting that controls whether to create ingress objects for services that support them.

When `false` the `global.ingress.enabled` setting is used.

Defaults to `false`.

### ingress.tls.secretName

The name of the Kubernetes TLS Secret that contains a valid certificate and key for the gitlab url.

When not set, the `global.ingress.tls.secretName` is used instead.

Defaults to not being set.

### ingress.annotations.annotation-key

Where `annotation-key` is a string that will be used with the value as an annotation on every ingress.

ex:

`ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/enable-access-log"=true`

No annotations are provided by default.

## External Services

### Redis

```YAML
redis:
  host: redis.example.com
  serviceName: redis
  port: 6379
  password:
    secret: gitlab-redis
    key: redis-password
```

#### host

The hostname of the Redis server with the database to use. This can be omitted in lieu of `serviceName`

#### serviceName

The name of the `service` which is operating the Redis database. If this is present, and `host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `host` value. This is convenient when using Redis as a part of the overall GitLab chart. This will default to `redis`

#### port

The port on which to connect to the Redis server. Defaults to `6379`.

#### password

The `password` attribute for Redis has to sub keys:
- `secret` defines the name of the kubernetes `Secret` to pull from
- `key` defines the name of the key in the above secret that contains the password.

### PostgreSQL

```YAML
psql:
  host: psql.example.com
  port: 5432
  database: gitlabhq_production
  username: gitlab
  password:
    secret: gitlab-postgres
    key: psql-password
```

#### host

The hostname of the PostgreSQL server with the database to use. This can be omitted if `postgresql.install=true` (default non-production).

#### port

The port on which to connect to the PostgreSQL server. Defaults to `5432`.

#### database

The name of the database to use on the PostgreSQL server. This defaults to `gitlabhq_production`.

#### username

The username with which to authenticate to the database. This defaults to `gitlab`

#### password

The `password` attribute for PostgreSQL has to sub keys:
- `secret` defines the name of the kubernetes `Secret` to pull from
- `key` defines the name of the key in the above secret that contains the password.

### Gitaly

```YAML
gitaly:
  internal:
    names:
      - default
      - default2
  external:
    - name: node1
      hostname: node1.example.com
      port: 8079
  authToken:
    secret: gitaly-secret
    key: token
```

#### host

The hostname of the Gitaly server to use. This can be omitted in lieu of `serviceName`

#### serviceName

The name of the `service` which is operating the Gitaly server. If this is present, and `host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `host` value. This is convenient when using Gitaly as a part of the overall GitLab chart. This will default to `gitaly`

#### port

The port on which to connect to the Gitaly server. Defaults to `8075`.

#### authToken

The `authToken` attribute for Gitaly has to sub keys:
- `secret` defines the name of the kubernetes `Secret` to pull from
- `key` defines the name of the key in the above secret that contains the authToken.

### Minio

```YAML
minio:
  serviceName: 'minio-svc'
  port: 9000
```

#### serviceName

Name of the `Service` that exposed by Minio pod.

Defaults to `minio-svc`.

#### port

Port number to reach the Minio `Service` on.

Defaults to `9000`.

### Registry

```YAML
registry:
  host: registry.example.com
  port: 443
  api:
    protocol: http
    host: registry.example.com
    serviceName: registry
    port: 5000
  tokenIssuer: gitlab-issuer
  certificate:
    secret: gitlab-registry
    key: registry-auth.key
```

#### host

The external hostname to use for providing docker commands to users in the GitLab UI. Falls back to the value set in the
`registry.hostname` template. Which determines the registry hostname based on the values set in `global.hosts`. See the [Globals Documentation][globals]
for more information.

#### port

The external port used in the hostname. Using port `80` or `443` will result in the URLs being formed with `http`/`https`. Other ports
will all use `http` and append the port to the end of hostname. ex: `http://registry.example.com:8443`

#### api

Field `api` is a map containing four items: `host`, `protocol`, `serviceName`, and `port`

#### api.host

The hostname of the Registry server to use. This can be omitted in lieu of `api.serviceName`

#### api.protocol

The protocol Unicorn should use to reach the Registry api.

#### api.serviceName

The name of the `service` which is operating the Registry server. If this is present, and `api.host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `api.host` value. This is convenient when using Registry as a part of the overall GitLab chart. This will default to `registry`

#### api.port

The port on which to connect to the Registry api. Defaults to `5000`.

#### tokenIssuer

The name of the auth token issuer. This must match the name used in the Registry's configuration, as it incorporated into the token when it is sent. Defaults to `gitlab-issuer`, which is the same default we use in the Registry chart.

#### certificate

Field `certificate` is a map containing two items: `secret` and `key`.

#### certificate.secret

`secret` is a string containing the name of the [Kubernetes Secret][kubernetes-secret] that houses the certificate bundle to be used to verify the tokens created by the GitLab instance(s).

#### certificate.key

`key` is the name of the `key` in the `Secret` which houses the certificate
bundle that will be provided to the [registry][] container as `auth.token.rootcertbundle`.

## Chart Settings

The following values are used to configure the Unicorn Pods.

#### replicaCount

Field `replicaCount` is an integer, controlling the number of Unicorn instances to create in the deployment. This defaults to `1`.

#### workerProcesses

Field `workerProcesses` is an integer, controller the number of Unicorn workers to run per pod. You must have at least `2` workers available in your cluster in order for GitLab to properly function. Note that as you increase the `workerProcesses` the memory required will increase by approximately `400MB`, so you should update the pod `resources` accordingly.  `workerProcesses` defaults to `2`.

#### workerTimeout

Field `workerTimeout` is an integer specifying the number of seconds a request can be pending before it times out. Defaults to `60`

### metrics.enabled

By default, each pod exposes a metrics endpoint at `/-/metrics`. Metrics are only available when [GitLab Prometheus metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html) are enabled in the Admin area. When metrics are enabled, annotations are added to each pod allowing a Prometheus server to discover and scrape the exposed metrics.

### GitLab Shell

GitLab Shell uses an Auth Token in its communication with Unicorn. Share the token with GitLab Shell and Unicorn using a shared Secret.

```YAML
shell:
  authToken:
   secret: gitlab-shell-secret
   key: secret
  port:
```

#### authToken

The `authToken` attribute for Gitaly has to sub keys:
- `secret` defines the name of the kubernetes `Secret` to pull from
- `key` defines the name of the key in the above secret that contains the authToken.

#### port

The port number to use in the generation of SSH URLs within the GitLab UI. Defaults to `22`, and is controlled by `global.shell.port`.
