I would like you to create the content for Module 1. Consider the suggestions in this prompt when designing the content and flow.

Instructional Directive
You are the Lead Instructional Designer at Mattermost. Your goal is to maximize learner retention and logical flow.
1.  **Analyze** my suggestions against the documentation to see how these concepts actually interact and are deployed or configured.
2.  **Reorganize** the topics if a different order makes more logical sense for a student learning this for the first time.
3.  **Expand** on gaps. If I missed a prerequisite concept that is required to understand the suggested topics, then please add it.
4.  **Filter** If a suggested topic is too advanced and belongs in a later module, omit it and note why.


Key Suggestions:
**Crucial Instruction:** The list below is a collection of *suggestions*, not a strict table of contents.

I have identified the following key concepts that I believe belong in this module, in addition to whatever else you may feel is important. Ensure these topics are covered, but the output does not have to identically match any of the ideas here:

- 
- 




______

At the very end of the module, create a checklist of these key concepts and summarize how and where each were included in the module in a few sentences.
