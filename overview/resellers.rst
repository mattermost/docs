Reseller Programs 
==============================

Mattermost, Inc. works with qualified resellers to distribute Mattermost Enterprise Edition in local markets. This page outlines reseller programs available. 

Certified Resellers 
-------------------------------

Certified resellers are qualified partners entering agreements to resell Mattermost Enterprise Edition in local markets and provide first and 2nd tier customer support to local customers.  

1. **Inquire about becoming a certified reseller** `via our website contact form <https://about.mattermost.com/contact/>`_. Qualified reseller candidates are contacted to enter into a certified reseller agreement with Mattermost, Inc. and are `listed on our partner page. <https://about.mattermost.com/partners/>`_ 

2. **Register a deal** when you have a qualified opportunity using our `deal registration page <https://about.mattermost.com/reseller-deal-registration/>`_ to confirm the customer is not already in contact with Mattermost, Inc. or another reseller. 

3. **Request a quotation** from your reseller manager after receiving a customer order.

4. **Sign the quotation** and send it to your reseller manager at Mattermost, Inc. who will issue an invoice to your firm and send the customer instructions to complete the `customer registration process <https://about.mattermost.com/customer-registration/>`_ in order to receive a license key. 

Pass-through Resellers
-------------------------------

While Mattermost, Inc. does not offer the resale of Mattermost products without a signed reseller agreement, we will provide customer quotations for a reseller to pass through to customers to sign in order to procure Mattermost products.
