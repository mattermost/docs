WARNING: Automatic TLS certificate generation with cert-manager is disabled and no TLS certificates were provided. Self-signed certificates were generated.

You may retrieve the CA root for these certificates from the `{{ template "gitlab.wildcard-self-signed-cert-name" $ }}-ca` secret, via the following command. It can then be imported to a web browser or system store.

    kubectl get secret {{ template "gitlab.wildcard-self-signed-cert-name" $ }}-ca -ojsonpath='{.data.cfssl_ca}' | base64 --decode > {{ template "gitlab.gitlab.hostname" $ }}.ca.pem

If you do not wish to use self-signed certificates, please set the following properties:
  - global.ingress.tls.secretName
  OR
  - global.ingress.tls.enabled (set to `true`)

NOTICE: You've installed GitLab Runner without the ability to use 'docker in docker'.
The GitLab Runner chart (gitlab/gitlab-runner) is deployed without the `privileged` flag by default for security purposes. This can be changed by setting `gitlab-runner.runners.privileged` to `true`. Before doing so, please the GitLab Runner chart's documenation on why we
chose not to enable this by default. See https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#running-docker-in-docker-containers-with-gitlab-runners

WARNING: If you are upgrading from a previous version of the GitLab Helm Chart, there is a major upgrade to the included PostgreSQL chart, which requires manual steps be performed. Please see our upgrade documentation for more information: https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/upgrade.html
