# Notice.txt File Configuration

We are automatically generating Notice.txt by using first-level dependencies of the project. The related pipeline uses `config.yaml` stored in this folder.


## Pipfile configuration
For every dependency please add `# Repo: https://github.com/owner/repo` url. Sample:

```
# Add a "copy" button to code blocks in Sphinx (https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
# Repo: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-copybutton
sphinx-copybutton = "0.5.0"
```
