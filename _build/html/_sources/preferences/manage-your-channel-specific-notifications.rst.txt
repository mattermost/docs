By default, your web and desktop notification preferences apply to all channels you’re a member of. You can customize your per-channel notification preferences for any channel you're a member of for the following actions:

- `Mute channels <#mute-channels>`__
- `Ignore channel-wide @mentions <#ignore-channel-wide-@mentions>`__
- `Message notification sounds <#message-notification-sounds>`__
- `Auto-follow all new threads <#auto-follow-all-new-channel-threads>`__

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  You have 2 ways to manage notification preferences per channel:

  1. Select the channel name, then select **Notification Preferences** from the drop-down list.

  2. Alternatively, select the channel's **View Info** |channel-info| icon, and then select **Notification Preferences** in the right pane.

.. tab:: Mobile

  Tap the channel name, and then tap **Mobile Notifications**.

Mute channels
-------------

All channels are unmuted by default, including direct and group messages, as well as private and public channels. 

You can choose to mute or unmute a channel at any time as follows:

- Select **Mute Conversation** or **Unmute Conversation** for direct and group messages.
- Select **Mute Channel** or **Unmute Channel** for private and public channels.

Once a channel is muted:

- All notifications for that channel are disabled, including email, desktop, incoming call ring tones, and push notifications.
- The muted channel displays a mute icon next to the channel name.
- The channel is greyed out in the channel sidebar, and doesn't appear bold to indicate unread messages unless you’re :doc:`@mentioned </collaborate/mention-people>` in that channel directly.

Ignore channel-wide @mentions
------------------------------

By default, you're notified every time someone uses channel-wide :doc:`@mentions </collaborate/mention-people>` including :ref:`@channel and @all <collaborate/mention-people:@channel and @all>`, as well as :ref:`@here <collaborate/mention-people:@here>`.

When you choose to ignore channel-wide @mentions in channels, the channel name is bolded in the channel sidebar for new unreads unless it's muted.

Message notification sounds
---------------------------

From Mattermost v10.1, when you configure Mattermost to notify you about all new messages, or mentions, direct messages, and keywords only, on a per-channel basis, you can also specify an audible message notification sound to play for those notifications.

Follow all new channel threads
-------------------------------

By default, you don’t automatically follow new conversation threads in any channel unless you start a thread or reply to a thread, follow a thread, or are @mentioned in a thread.

When using Mattermost on your mobile device, you can configure Mattermost to automatically follow every thread in a channel.

1. In a channel, tap the **More** icon |more-icon| to the right of the channel name.
2. Tap **View info**.
3. Tap **Follow all threads**.

Tap **Threads** in the channel list to access all threads you're following, and to unfollow threads you no longer want to follow.
