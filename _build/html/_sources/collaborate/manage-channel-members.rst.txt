Add members to a channel
------------------------

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, any member of a channel can add other members to public or private channels, unless your system admin has restricted access to do so.

.. tab:: Web/Desktop

  1. Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Add Members**.

  2. Search for users, select users, then select **Add** to add users to the current channel. Mattermost notifies you when a user is already a member of the channel.

  .. tip::

    - From Mattermost v7.8, people you've messaged directly are listed first, followed by all users in alphabetical order. 
    - Alternatively, to add members to a channel, select the channel name, select the **View Info** |channel-info| icon, select **Members** in the right pane, and then select **Add**.

.. tab:: Mobile

  1. Tap the channel name at the top of the screen.
